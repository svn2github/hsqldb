            <tt>ASC</tt> may be ommited as it is the default qualifier and only supported index behavior;
            the <tt>DESC</tt> qualifier constitutes legal syntax, but only in the interest of compatibility
            with other SQL dialects.</p>
        <p>
            As per the SQL standard, the name of an index must be unique within the schema of
            the table upon which it is defined.</p>
        <p>
            Note that unique indexes are deprecated; please use <tt>UNIQUE<tt> constraints instead (which

            The next value for a sequence can be included in SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE statements

        <p>
            <tt>TriggerClass<tt> is an application-supplied class that implements the <tt>org.hsqldb.Trigger</tt>
            interface, such as "My.Name.Space.TrigClass".</p>
        <p>
            It is the <em>fire</em> method of this interface that is invoked when the trigger
            event occurs. You must ensure this class can be loaded and from within the application
            domain of the running database instance, and the class must provide a zero-argument
			constructor that is possible to invoke reflectively at runtime.</p>
        <p>
            When the 'fire' method of the interface is invoked, it is passed the following arguments:</p>
        <pre lang="C#">    fire (string triggerName, string tableName, object[] oldRow, object[] newRow)
		</pre>
        <p>
            where <tt>oldRow</tt> and <tt>newRow</tt> represent the 'before' and 'after' states of the current
            row, with column values supplied in declaration order.</p>
        <p>
            The mapping of row array values to database types is the internal mapping listed
            in the SQL Type Mapping table presented at the begining of the <a href="../../SQL Data Types.html">
			SQL Data Types</a> topic. If a value in <tt>newRow</tt> is to be modified by the trigger,
            it must be of the correct internal type or database corruption will result.</p>
        <p>
            Note that the number of elements in each row array is larger than the number of
            columns in the table. Never modify elements of the array beyond the column count
            of the table that fires the trigger, as this will also lead to database corruption.</p>
        <p>
            If a trigger method needs to access the firing database instance, it must establish
            its own connection, since one is not supplied in the method signature. Currently,
			attempting to execute commands on the same database instance during trigger execution
			can lead data inconsistency and other problems, such as deadlock, so it is not
			recommended.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation notes:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The default queue size is 1024.</p>
        <p>
            If <tt>QUEUE 0</tt> is specified, the fire method is executed in the same thread as the database
            engine, which allows a trigger action to <em>"safely"</em> alter the data that is
            about to be stored in the database, in so much as this situation offers a garantee
            regarding the order of operations; although not enforced, when the queue size is
            specified non-zero, a trigger action <em><strong>must not</strong></em> alter data
            in the <tt>newRow</tt> array, as there is no garantee regarding the order of operations. That
            is, by the time the trigger action executes, the <tt>newRow</tt> array may no longer actually
            be referenced by the database (it may have been subject to replacement in the interim,
            e.g. via update or delete, and hence is otherwise ready for garbage collection)
            or worse, the trigger action may execute out of sequence with respect to other validation,
            integrity or persistence concerns, leading to database corruption.</p>
        <p>
            In general, when <tt>QUEUE 0</tt> is specified, data may be checked or modified in BEFORE
            INSERT / UPDATE + FOR EACH ROW triggers. All declared table constraints are then
            enforced by the database engine and if there is a violation, the action is rejected
            for the SQL command that initiated the INSERT or UPDATE.</p>
        <p>
            There is an exception to this rule, which is that with UPDATE queries, referential
            integrity and cascading actions resulting from ON UPDATE CASCASE / SET NULL / SET
            DEFAULT are all performed prior to the invocation of the trigger method. Hence,
            if an invalid value that breaks referential integrity is inserted in the row by
            the trigger method, this action is not checked and results in inconsistent data
            in the table.</p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, if a trigger is to be used to provide external notification and not
            for checking or altering the data, then a queue size larger than zero should be
            specified, so that the main thread may proceed without blocking on external i/o
            operations.</p>
        <p>
            When the queue size is specified greater than zero, the engine utilizes an event
            queue that is processed by a dedicated trigger thread. This is particularly useful
            with 'FOR EACH ROW' triggers, when a large number of events occur in rapid succession,
            without the trigger thread getting a chance to run. However, if the queue becomes
            full, subsequent additions cause the main thread to block, awaiting space in the
            queue.</p>
        <p>
            Take great care if a triggered action involves accessing the same database instance.
            Deadlock will always occur for each row triggers with queue size of zero. This can
            be avoided either by ensuring the QUEUE parameter is large enough that access does
            not need to occur until after each row is processed by the main thread, or by using
            the NOWAIT parameter which causes new trigger events to overwrite the tail of the
            queue.</p>
        <p>
            Note also that the timing of trigger method calls is not guaranteed when the queue
            size is non-zero, so applications should implement their own synchronization measures
            if necessary.</p>
        <p>
            Finally, you absolutely must not modify newRow[] values when the queue size is non-zero.
            Due to the non-deterministic timing to thread execution, such modifications will,
            at worst, almost certainly result in data inconsistency, and at best are not guaranteed
            to become visible in the database.</p>

            A view may be thought of as either a virtual table or a stored query. The data accessible
            through a view is not stored in the database as a distinct table object. Instead,
            what is stored in the database is a view descriptor which includes an SQL SELECT
            statement. The subset of the relation satisfying the stored SELECT statement at
            execution time constitutes the virtual table exposed through the view. So, an SQL
            statement that references a view may be used to access this virtual table in a way
            that is indistinguishable from accessing a base table.
        </p>
        <p>
            A view may be used in any or all of these functions:</p>
        <div>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To restrict access to specific rows. For example, to restrict an employee from access
                        to rows other than those recording his or her own work in a labor-tracking table.&nbsp;
                        In the relational calculus, this is refered to as a SELECTION.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To restrict access to specific columns. For example, to restrict non-payroll employees
                        from access to columns containing salary or personal information. In the relational
                        calculus, this is refered to as a PROJECTION.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To combine the columns from multiple tables so that the result is indistiguishable
                        from a single table. In the relational calculus, this is refered to as a JOIN</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To aggregate and group information instead of supplying details. For example, to
                        present the sum, maximum, minimum, average value from a column or to present a count
                        of the occurences of each distinct value in a column.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            The base tables referenced by the SELECT statement portion of a view's descriptor
            are known as the base tables for the view. In the following example, a view is created
            that references data in three base tables, <em>meals</em>, <em>mealtype</em> and
            <em>author</em>, to expose a new, virtual table containing commonly associated data:</p>
        <div>
            <pre lang="sql">
CREATE VIEW mealsjv AS
     SELECT m.mid AS mid
           ,m.name AS name
           ,t.mealtype AS mt
           ,a.aid AS aid
           ,a.gname + ' ' + a.sname AS author
           ,m.description AS description
           ,m.asof AS asof
       FROM meal AS m
       JOIN mealtype AS t ON (m.mealtype = t.mealtype)
       JOIN author AS a ON (m.aid = a.aid);
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            By reference to <em>mealsjv</em> in SQL statements, it is possible to access the
            virtual table in the same way one would reference a base table:</p>
        <div>
            <pre lang="sql">
SELECT * FROM mealsjv;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            In addition to base table references, a view's <tt>SELECT</tt> statement may also reference
            pre-existing views.&nbsp; In the following example, a new view is created that references
            the pre-exising <em>mealsjv</em> view to provide a more compact representation of
            the data to be used to render a (typically space-constrained) web page:</p>
        <div>
            <pre lang="sql">
CREATE VIEW mealswebv AS SELECT DISTINCT name, author FROM mealsjv;
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Unlike the case of direct <tt>SELECT</tt> statement execution, it is generally the case that
            special care should be taken to ensure VIEW definitions do not expose duplicate
            column names. The reason for this is to avoid ambiguous column name conditions
            that may otherwise possibly arise, such as when attempting to project or join on
            a view's columns.</p>
        <p>
            If the names of two columns in the <tt>SELECT</tt> statement are the same, then the descriptor
            should contain a column alias list to distinguish between them. A list of new column
            names can always be defined for a view.</p>
        <div>
            <pre lang="sql">
CREATE VIEW v_book (book_name, author_name, publisher_name) AS
     SELECT b.name, a.name, p.name
       FROM book b 
       JOIN author a on (b.author_id = a.id) 
       JOIN publisher p on (b.publisher_id = p.id)
    </pre>
        </div>
        <div id="footer">
            <div class="footerLine">
                <hr />

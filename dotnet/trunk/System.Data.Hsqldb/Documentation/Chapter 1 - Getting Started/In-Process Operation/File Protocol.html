        <p>
            If a database is named <tt>testdb</tt> and its files are located in the present
            working directory, the following code makes the correct connection:</p>
        <pre lang="cs">    using(DbConnection connection = dbFactory.CreateConnection())
    {
        connection.ConnectionString = "Protocol=File;Path=testdb;User ID=SA";
        connection.Open();
        // ...
        </pre>
        <p>
            Forward slashes are known to work under both Windows and POSIX file system hosts,
            facilitating <em>almost</em> platform-independent path specification.</p>
        <p>
            For example, if one's POSIX file system database path is <tt>/opt/db/testdb</tt>
            and one creates an identical directory structure on the Windows <em>%SystemDrive%</em>
            (typically C:\), the following path will work identically on both systems:</p>
        <pre lang="cs">    connection.ConnectionString = "Protocol=File;Path=/opt/db/testdb;User ID=SA";
    </pre>
        <p>
            However, please note that, as per the behavior of the java.io.File class, relative
            paths are resolved against the present working directory (usually available as the
            read-only "user.dir" java.lang.System property) in effect when the IKVM runtime
            initializes, <em>not</em> the present working directory in effect when a connection
            is opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please also note that, from the restricted (i.e. platform-independent) perspective
            of the java.io.File class, there really is no such thing as a present working directory
            at all. Instead, one is expected simply to access files relative to new java.io.File(".")
            and it is left system dependent as to how the cannoical path of "." is resolved.&nbsp;
            However, it is to be expected that, for the majority of Windows and POSIX file system
            hosts, java.io.File(".") resolves to the present working directory in effect for
            the operating system process that launches the .NET executable.

            <strong>Guidelines:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">Both relative and absolute database file paths <em>
                are</em> supported. </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">Relative database file paths can be specified in a
                platform independent manner as: <em>[dir1/dir2/.../dirn/]&lt;file-name-prefix&gt;</em>
            </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">Specification of absolute file paths is operating-system
                specific.<br>
                Please read your OS file system documentation. </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">Specification of network mounts may be operating-system
                specific (and is not recommended)<br>
                Please read your OS file system documentation. </li>
            <li>Special care may be needed w.r.t. file path specifications containing white-space,
                mixed-case, special characters and/or reserved file names.<br>
                Please read your OS file system documentation.</li>

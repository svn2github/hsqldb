            SQL integrity constraints, generally referred to simply as constraints, define the
            valid states of SQL-data by constraining the values in the base tables. A constraint
            is described by a constraint descriptor. The SQL standard defines that a constraint
            is either a table constraint, a domain constraint, or an assertion which is described
            by, respectively, a table constraint descriptor, a domain constraint descriptor,
            or an assertion descriptor.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">At present, HSQLDB supports only table constaints.</em></p>
        <p>
            By definition, every constraint descriptor includes:</p>
        <p>
            — The name of the constraint,</p>
        <p>
            — An applicable &lt;search condition&gt;,</p>
        <p>
            — An indication of whether or not the constraint is deferrable,</p>
        <p>
            — An indication of whether the initial constraint mode is deferred or immediate</p>
        <p>
            with the limitation that each integrity constraint shall be defined using a &lt;search
            condition&gt; that is not <dfn>retrospectively deterministic</dfn>.</p>
        <h4>
            Checking of constraints</h4>
        <p>
            The standard states that every constraint is either deferrable or non-deferrable.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">At present, HSQLDB supports only non-deferrable constraints.</em></p>
        <p>
            Within an SQL-transaction, every constraint has a constraint mode; if a constraint
            is non-deferrable, <em class="nb">as is presently always the case with HSQLDB</em>, then its
            constraint mode is always immediate; otherwise, it is either immediate or deferred.
            Every constraint has an initial constraint mode that specifies the constraint mode
            for that constraint at the start of each SQL-transaction and immediately after definition
            of that constraint.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">At present, the constraint mode is implicitly an immutably immediate for all HSQLDB
                constraints.</em></p>
        <p>
            If a constraint is deferrable, <em class="nb">as may be supported in a future HSQLDB release</em>,
            then its constraint mode may be changed (from immediate to deferred, or from deferred
            to immediate) by execution of a &lt;set constraints mode statement&gt;.</p>
        <p>
            The checking of a constraint depends on its constraint mode within the current SQL-transaction.
            Whenever an SQL-statement is executed, every constraint whose mode is immediate
            is checked, at a certain point after any changes to SQL-data and schemas resulting
            from that execution have been effected, to see if it is satisfied. A constraint
            is satisfied if and only if the applicable &lt;search condition&gt; included in
            its descriptor evaluates to <em>True</em> or <em>Unknown</em>. If any constraint
            is not satisfied, then any changes to SQL-data or schemas resulting from executing
            that statement are canceled.</p>
        <p>
            The standard states that the constraint mode can be set to immediate either explicitly
            by execution of a &lt;set constraints mode statement&gt; or implicitly at the end
            of the current SQL-transaction.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">HSQLDB does not presently support &lt;set constraints mode statement&gt;.</em></p>
        <p>
            When a &lt;commit statement&gt; is executed, all constraints are effectively checked
            and, if any constraint is not satisfied, then an exception condition is raised and
            the SQL-transaction is terminated by an implicit &lt;rollback statement&gt;.</p>
        <h3>
            Table constraints</h3>
        <p>
            A table constraint is a constraint whose descriptor is included in a base table
            descriptor. Being associated with a particular base table allows for convenient
            syntactic shorthands in which universal quantification over the rows of the table
            in question is implied.</p>
        <p>
            A table constraint is either a unique constraint, a referential constraint or a
            table check constraint. A table constraint is described by a table constraint descriptor,
            which is either a unique constraint descriptor, a referential constraint descriptor,
            or a table check constraint descriptor, respectively.</p>
        <p>
            The standard specifies that every table constraint specified for base table T is
            implicitly a constraint on every subtable of T, by virtue of the fact that every
            row in a subtable is considered to have a corresponding superrow in every one of
            its supertables.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">At present, HSQLDB does not support the concept of sub and super-tables.</em></p>
        <p>
            A unique constraint is satisfied if and only if no two rows in a table have the
            same non-null values in the unique columns. In addition, if the unique constraint
            was defined with PRIMARY KEY, then it requires that none of the values in the specified
            column or columns be a null value.</p>
        <p>
            In addition to the components of every table constraint descriptor, a unique constraint
            descriptor includes:</p>
        <p>
            — An indication of whether it was defined with PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE.</p>
        <p>
            — The names and positions of the unique columns specified in the &lt;unique column
            list&gt;.</p>
        <p>
            If the table descriptor for base table T includes a unique constraint descriptor
            indicating that the unique constraint was defined with PRIMARY KEY, then the columns
            of that unique constraint constitute the primary key of T.</p>
        <p>
            The standard specifies that a table with a primary key cannot have a proper supertable.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">Again, HSQLDB does not currently support the concept of sub and super-tables.</em></p>
        <p>
            In addition to the components of every table constraint descriptor, a referential
            constraint descriptor includes:</p>
        <p>
            — A list of the names of the referencing columns specified in the &lt;referencing
            columns&gt;.</p>
        <p>
            — The referenced table specified in the &lt;referenced table and columns&gt;.</p>
        <p>
            — A list of the names of the referenced columns specified in the &lt;referenced
            table and columns&gt;.</p>
        <p>
            — The value of the &lt;match type&gt;, if specified, and the &lt;referential triggered
            action&gt;, if specified.</p>
        <p>
            The ordering of the lists of referencing column names and referenced column names
            is interpreted such that corresponding column names occupy corresponding positions
            in each list.</p>
        <p>
            In the case that a table constraint is a referential constraint, the table is referred
            to as the referencing table. The referenced columns of a referential constraint
            must be the unique columns of some unique constraint of the referenced table.</p>
        <p>
            According to the standard, a referential constraint is satisfied if one of the following
            conditions is true, depending on the &lt;match type&gt; specified in the &lt;referential
            constraint definition&gt;:</p>
        <p>
            — If no &lt;match type&gt; was specified then, for each row R1 of the referencing
            table, either at least one of the values of the referencing columns in R1 shall
            be a null value, or the value of each referencing column in R1 shall be equal to
            the value of the corresponding referenced column in some row of the referenced table.</p>
        <p>
            — If MATCH FULL was specified then, for each row R1 of the referencing table, either
            the value of every referencing column in R1 shall be a null value, or the value
            of every referencing column in R1 shall not be null and there shall be some row
            R2 of the referenced table such that the value of each referencing column in R1
            is equal to the value of the corresponding referenced column in R2.</p>
        <p>
            — If MATCH PARTIAL was specified then, for each row R1 of the referencing table,
            there shall be some row R2 of the referenced table such that the value of each referencing
            column in R1 is either null or is equal to the value of the corresponding referenced
            column in R2.</p>
        <p>
            The referencing table may be the same table as the referenced table.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">At present, HSQLDB does not support the MATCH FULL or MATCH PARTIAL options.</em></p>
        <p>
            A table check constraint is satisfied if and only if the specified &lt;search condition&gt;
            evaluates to <em>True</em> or <em>Unknown</em> for every row of the table to which
            it applies.</p>
        <p>
            At present, HSQLDB limits the &lt;search condition&gt; of a table check constraint
            in that it may reference only the values the row being inserted or updated.</p>
        <h3>
            Domain constraints</h3>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">At present, HSQLDB does not support domain constraint declarations, although they will be supported in a future release.</em></p>
        <p>
            A domain constraint is a constraint that is specified for a domain. It is applied
            to all columns that are based on that domain, and to all values cast to that domain.</p>
        <p>
            A domain constraint is described by a domain constraint descriptor. In addition
            to the components of every constraint descriptor, a domain constraint descriptor
            includes:</p>
        <p>
            — The template &lt;search condition&gt; for the generation of domain constraint
            usage &lt;search condition&gt;s.</p>
        <p>
            — A possibly empty set of domain constraint usages.</p>
        <p>
            A domain constraint usage descriptor is created implicitly by the evaluation of
            a &lt;column definition&gt; whose &lt;data type or domain name&gt; is a &lt;domain
            name&gt;. If C is such a column and D is the domain identified by the &lt;domain
            name&gt;, then every domain constraint DC defined for D implies a domain constraint
            usage, to the effect that each value in C satisfies DC.</p>
        <p>
            In addition to the components of every table constraint descriptor, a domain constraint
            usage descriptor includes:</p>
        <p>
            — The name of the applicable column.</p>
        <p>
            — The applicable &lt;search condition&gt; that evaluates whether each value in C
            satisfies DC.</p>
        <p>
            A domain constraint is satisfied by SQL-data if and only if, for every table T that
            has a column named C based on that domain, the applicable &lt;search condition&gt;
            recorded in the appropriate domain constraint usage evaluates to <em>True</em> or
            <em>Unknown</em>.</p>
        <p>
            A domain constraint is satisfied by the result of a &lt;cast specification&gt; if
            and only if the specified template &lt;search condition&gt;, with each occurrence
            of the &lt;general value specification&gt; VALUE replaced by that result, evaluates
            to <em>True</em> or <em>Unknown</em>.</p>
        <h3>
            Assertions</h3>
        <p>
            An assertion is a constraint whose descriptor is an independent schema component
            not included in any table descriptor.</p>
        <p>
            <em class="nb">At present, HSQLDB does not support Assertions and there is no current plan to support
                them in the future.</em></p>
        <p>
            Indeed, very few DBMS support Assertions.</p>

        <p>
            Because they do no affect the actual semantics of the relational calculus, the SQL
            standard is completely silent on the matter of indexes</p>
        <p>
            However, as with most RDBMS, HSQLDB indexes play a crucial role in improving &lt;search-condition&gt;
            performance (such as in SQL SELECT and heavily predicated SQL UPDATE or DELETE operations)
            , although typically at the cost of decreased performance for SQL INSERT (and even
            lightly predicated SQL UPDATE and DELETE) performance, due to the overhead of maintaining
            index information.</p>
        <p>
            If no indexes exist in an HSQLDB database, then the current architecture dictates
            that all rows of all involved tables must be examined at least once and possibly
            many times to perform each search.</p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, when there is an index on a column in an SQL <tt>WHERE</tt> clause,
            it is often possible to significantly reduce the number of rows that must be examined,
            in turn reducing CPU load and possibly disk access overhead.</p>
        <p>
            And indexes are even more important in joins between multiple tables. For example:</p>
        <pre lang="sql">    SELECT ... FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON (t1.c1 = t2.c2)
        </pre>
        <p>
            is performed by fetching the rows of t1 one by one and finding, one by one, the
            matching rows in <tt>
                <var>
                    t2</var></tt>.</p>
        <p>
            If there is no index index on <tt>
                <var>
                    t1.c1</var></tt> or <tt>
                        <var>
                            t2.c2</var></tt>, then for each row of <tt>
                                <var>
                                    t1</var></tt>, each row of <tt>
                                        <var>
                                            t2</var></tt> must be checked.</p>
        <p>
            That is, if <tt>
                <var>
                    t1</var></tt> and <tt>
                        <var>
                            t2</var></tt> each contain <tt>10,000</tt> rows, then a query without
            indexes requires <tt>100,000,000</tt> fetch/compare cycles.</p>
        <p>
            However, when an eligible index exists, the number of required checks may be <em>far</em>
            lower.</p>
        <p>
            For example, with an index on <tt>
                <var>
                    t2.c2</var></tt>, this is reduced to fetching of each row in <tt>
                        <var>
                            t1</var></tt> once, plus and index lookup on <tt>
                                <var>
                                    t2(c2)</var></tt> to find the matching rows.</p>
        <p>
            With a random distribution of <tt>
                <var>
                    c1,c2</var></tt> values in <tt>
                        <var>
                            t1,t2</var></tt>, the theoretical number of required operations
            is reduced to <tt>O(n*log(n))</tt> or ~<tt>1000</tt> times fewer operations in the
            concrete case above.</p>
        <h3>
            Notes</h3>
        <p>
            Recall that, like most DBMS, HSQLDB automatically creates backing indexes for primary
            key and unique constraints.</p>
        <p>
            Also, observe that each prefix of a multiple column unique index can be used internally
            as a non-unique index on the prefix columns.</p>
        <p>
            In other words:</p>
        <pre lang="sql">    CONSTRAINT name1 UNIQUE (c1, c2, c3);
        </pre>
        <p>
            is, for the purpose of improving select performance, equivalent to:</p>
        <pre lang="sql">    CREATE INDEX idx_xyz ON the_table(c1);
        </pre>
        <p>
            Additionally, HSQLDB can use multi-column indexes to improve select performance
            where there is a join or predicate on the values of <em>all</em> columns in the
            index, although it should be noted that the order in which the columns of the index
            or constraint are declared may affect the outcome: if the column that contains more
            diverse values appears first, the searches will be slightly faster and visa versa.</p>
        <p>
            Finally, HSQLDB features automatic, on-the-fly creation of indexes over views and
            sub-selects that are used in a query. For example, an indexed access path may be
            added to a view when it is joined with a table or another view.</p>
        <p>
            Otherwise, one should analyze the work to be performed by one's application and
            define indexes in support of the identified work using the <tt>CREATE INDEX</tt>
            command.</p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, HSQLDB does not currently implement an optimizer that considers multiple
            join orders when creating an execution plan for a query. Instead, it simply uses
            the order specified in the query.</p>
        <p>
            As a result, the general rule is to write one's queries so that tables with the
            best narrowing conditions on its columns are listed first. With queries over larger
            data sets, changing the order in which tables, views and in-line virtual tables
            are listed / joined may significantly affect query performance.</p>
        <p>
            To get some idea of the HSQLDB index usage for a specific query production, one
            can review the output from the <tt><a href="../../Chapter 8 - SQL Syntax/SQL Commands/Data Query And Manipulation Language Commands.html#explain-plan-section">
                EXPLAIN PLAN FOR &lt;query&gt;</a></tt> command.</p>

        <p>
            HSQLDB currently supports transactions only at the <tt>READ_UNCOMMITTED</tt> level,
            also known as <tt>LEVEL 0</tt> transaction isolation.</p>
        <p>
            This means that during the lifetime of a transaction, other database sessions can
            see uncommitted changes made by that transaction.</p>
        <p>
            Also, HSQLDB does not currently support transactional <dfn>DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE</dfn>
            (<tt>DDL</tt>). Instead, when an SQL <tt>CREATE | ALTER | DROP TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN</tt>
            or <tt>DROP COLUMN</tt> command results in changes to the table structure, the current
            transaction is committed. If an uncommitted transaction in a different session has
            changed the data in the affected table, it may not be possible to roll it back after
            the <tt>ALTER TABLE</tt> command. This may also apply to <tt>ADD | DROP INDEX</tt>
            an <tt>ADD | DROP CONSTRAINT</tt> commands. It is recommended to use <tt>DDL</tt>
            commands only when it is known that there are no in-progress transactions.</p>
        <p>
            Similarly, although uncommitted transactions can be continued, committed, or rolled
            back after a <tt>CHECKPOINT</tt> command is issued, if the database is not subsequently
            closed properly with the <tt>SHUTDOWN</tt> command, any such transactions that remain
            uncommitted at the time of shutdown are partly committed (to the state at <tt>CHECKPOINT</tt>)
            at the next startup. Because of this, it is presently recommended to use the <tt>CHECKPOINT</tt>
            command only when there are no in-progress transactions.</p>
        <p>
            Finally, the default behavior when different transactions modify the same row is
            to simply allow each transaction to commit using a "last writer wins policy."</p>
        <p>
            Recognizing that this not always an acceptable policy (especially since the case
            cannot be prevented by specifying a more restrictive isolation level), the following
            property is provided to indicate that an exception is to be raised when one transaction
            attempts to modify a row that belongs to a different transaction's write set:
        </p>
        <pre lang="sql">SET PROPERTY "sql.tx_no_multi_rewrite" TRUE
        </pre>
        <p>
            Other than the above issues, testing and bug feedback indicates that the HSQLDB
            transaction facility is mature and conforms fully to <dfn>ACID</dfn> (Atomic, Isolated,
            Consistent, Durable).</p>

            This section covers system related issues and answers some deployment questions that have been
            repeatedly posted in the HSQLDB forums and mailing lists.</p>
        <h3>
            Modes of Operation and Table Types</h3>
        <p>
            HSQLDB has an assortment of operation modes, table data storage engines and other
            features that allow it to be used in a number of widely varying scenarios.</p>
        <p>
            Levels of memory usage, speed and accessibility are influenced by how HSQLDB is
            deployed.</p>
        <h4>
            Modes of Operation</h4>
        <p>
            The decision to run HSQLDB as a separate server process or as an in-process database
            should be based on the following:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <p>
                    When run as a server on a separate machine, database instances are isolated from
                    hardware failures and crashes on the hosts running the application.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When run as a server on the same machine, database instances are isolated from application
                    crashes and application memory leaks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Server connections are slower than in-process connections due to network round-trip
                    latencies and the overhead of streaming the data for each database call.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            Table Types</h4>
        <p>
            <tt>TEXT</tt> tables are designed for special applications where the data has to
            be in an interchangeable format, such as comma-separated values (<dfn>CSV)</dfn>.
            The <tt>TEXT</tt> table storage engine is the slowest of the HSQLDB table storage
            engines; normally, <tt>TEXT</tt> tables should not be used for general-purpose data
            storage.</p>
        <p>
            <tt>MEMORY</tt> tables and <tt>CACHED</tt> tables, on the other hand, <em>are</em>
            suitable for general-purpose data storage. The differences include:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Normally, <tt>MEMORY</tt> table data is read completely into memory from the database
                    initialization <tt>.script</tt> when a database is opened and occupies physical
                    memory until the database is <tt>SHUTDOWN</tt>, the hosting table is dropped, or
                    rows are updated or deleted. In contrast, <tt>CACHED</tt> table data is read into
                    memory lazily, on demand and is subject to being swapped out of memory at any time
                    to make room for subsequent access to additional <tt>CACHED</tt> table data. Furthermore,
                    there are declarative policies that are strictly enforced regarding the maximum
                    number of rows and the maximum size, in bytes, occupied in memory by <tt>CACHED</tt>
                    table data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When a database is shutdown in the normal way, <em>all</em> <tt>MEMORY</tt> table
                    data is written to the database initialization <tt>.script</tt> in the form of <tt>SQL
                        INSERT</tt> statements, whereas only dirty <tt>CACHED</tt> table data that is
                    still buffered in memory is written to the binary <tt>.data</tt> image file in binary
                    format. Also, a compressed backup file is created from the <tt>.data</tt> file,
                    whereas, the database initialization <tt>.script</tt>
                requires no further processing. </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    As hinted above, the size and capacity of the row buffer for <tt>CACHED</tt> tables
                    is configurable. Thus, it is possible to specify settings that allow all <tt>CACHED</tt>
                    table data to be buffered in memory at once. In this case, the data access performance
                    characteristic is comparable to, but slightly less than that for <tt>MEMORY</tt>
                    tables, not incuding the overhead for initially loading all <tt>MEMORY</tt> table
                    data from disk into physical memory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For normal applications, it is recommended that <tt>MEMORY</tt> tables are used
                    for smaller data sets, leaving <tt>CACHED</tt> tables for large data sets. For special
                    applications where maximal access speed is absolutely paramount and there is enough
                    physical memory available, <tt>MEMORY</tt> tables may be used for large tables as
                    well, with the caveat that one pays for that last ounce of speed with longer startup
                    and shutdown times, although this can be mitigated somewhat by specifying alternate
                    database initialization file formats, as discussed in <a href="../Chapter 8 - SQL Syntax/SQL Commands/Database Control Commands.html#set_scriptformat-section">
                        Database Control Commands: SET SCRIPTFORMAT</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Large Objects</h3>
        <p>
            Character Large Object (<tt>CLOBS</tt>) are supported using the <tt>LONGVARCHAR</tt>
            data type. Binary Large Objects (<tt>BLOBS</tt>) are supported using the <tt>LONGVARBINARY</tt>
            data type. Serialized object data storage is supported using the <tt>OBJECT</tt>
            data type</p>
        <p>
            For best performance, it is not recommended to mix large object columns in a table
            with serveral standard column types; instead, the recommended practice is to split
            the declarations across at least two tables, where the first contains the standard
            fields plus a reference to the second table, which contains the large object column
            and the referenced key. Alternately, the second table may reference the first, if
            a one-to-many large object association is required (or an intersection table may
            be used, if serveral tables must reference the same large object data).</p>
        <p>
            This practice yeilds a number of benefits, the most important of which is that migrating
            large object data out of the primary table may allow it to be declared as a <tt>MEMORY</tt>
            table, maximizing access speed to the primary table and lowering memory pressure
            for regular queries against the primary data, while the secondary table may be declared
            CACHED, limiting large object loads to only those points where the large object
            data is absolutely required.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following demonstrates how to exploit the separation:
        </p>
        <pre lang="sql" title="Separating LOB data from primary data">
    CREATE MEMORY TABLE MAINTABLE(MAINID INTEGER, ......);
    CREATE CACHED TABLE LOBTABLE(LOBID INTEGER, LOBDATA LONGVARBINARY);

    SELECT *
      FROM (SELECT *
              FROM MAINTABLE &lt;join any other table&gt;
             WHERE &lt;various conditions apply&gt;)
      JOIN LOBTABLE ON (MAINID=LOBID);
        </pre>
        <p>
            The inner <tt>SELECT</tt> finds the required rows without reference to the <tt>LOBTABLE</tt>
            and when it has found all the rows, retrieves the related large objects from the
            <tt>LOBTABLE</tt>.</p>
        <h3>
            Disk And Memory Usage</h3>
        <h4>
            Disk Usage</h4>
        <p>
            HSQLDB locates all data files in the same directory. Data file creation and deletion
            should be left up to the database engine and the following principles must be observed:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <p>
                    The process running HSQLDB must have full privileges on the directory where the
                    files are stored. This includes full file-level read, write, create and delete privileges,
                    as well as the privilege to create any missing directories along the path to the
                    database files.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The file system must have enough spare room for both the permanent and temporary
                    data files. Note that:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>The default maximum size of the <tt>.log</tt> file is <tt>200MB</tt>.</li>
                    <li>The <tt>.data</tt> file can grow to up to <tt>8GB</tt>.</li>
                    <li>The <tt>.backup</tt> file is typically 50% the size of the <tt>.data</tt> file but
                        in theory can approach 100% the size of the <tt>.data</tt> file.</li>
                    <li>The temporary file created by <tt>SHUTDOWN COMPACT</tt> can be equal in size to
                        the <tt>.data</tt> file.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            Memory Usage</h4>
        <p>
            Database memory usage can be thought of a consisting of three distinct pools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>permanent - MEMORY table data and index structures</li>
            <li>dynamic - CACHED and SYSTEM table data and index structures</li>
            <li>transient - result sets and internal accounting structures created by data query
                and
                manipulation</li></ul>
        <p>
            Additionally, transactions utilize physical memory to represent rollback (undo)
            information.</p>
        <p>
            Over the last few releases, physical memory usage has been significantly reduced.&nbsp;
            As well, there is ongoing work to support spill-to-disk options for the transient
            memory pool and transaction undo lists.</p>
        <p>
            For the current release, however, it is still important to understand the general
            principles and implications of HSQLDB database memory usage policy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Memory used for table data</strong></p>
        <p>
            <tt>MEMORY</tt> table usage is the sum of memory used by each row, where each row
            is an object with two reference variables (~4 bytes each) and an object
            array representing column values. Each array slot is an object reference variable,
            such as to a <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt>, <tt>java.lang.Long</tt>, <tt>
                java.lang.String...</tt>,
            again typically consuming ~4 bytes plus the memory consumed by the referenced
            object itself (e.g. ~12 bytes for <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt>).</p>
        <p>
            As well, a user-defined table index adds a <tt>Node</tt> object to each row, where
            each <tt>Node</tt> has 6 reference variables (again, ~4 bytes each).</p>
        <p>
            As a result, a <tt>MEMORY</tt> table with just one column of type <tt>SQL INTEGER</tt>
            will consume ~80 bytes per row.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that each additional column adds at least a few bytes to the physical
            memory consumed by each row. Also note that the in-memory representation for character
            data is UTF-16, or two bytes per character, as opposed to UTF-8 on disk, or between
            one and three bytes per character.</p>
        <p>
            Per-row <tt>CACHED</tt> table usage is similar to, but more expensive than per-row
            <tt>MEMORY</tt> table usage, primarily because additional accounting structures
            are required to implement the policy used to buffer rows in memory; to associate
            each row with a location on disk; to determine the level of storage fragementation
            on disk.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Memory used for building result sets</strong></p>
        <p>
            Result set row usage is lower than table row usage (there are fewer variables and
            no index nodes), but is still considerable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Presently, the engine builds result sets 100% in memory, with no spill to disk. This limits
            the upper bound on result set size.</p>
        <p>
            Server mode database instances release the physical memory consumed while building
            a result set as soon as it
            has been transmitted to the client. However, transmission presently involves
            considerable overhead,
            specifically that required to first fully serialize the result set data into an
            array of bytes before writing to the client socket.</p>
        <p>
            In-process databases, on the other hand, have no control over when result set memory
            is released; the client software may hold a reference to a result set indefinitely after
            its generating query operation returns.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Memory used to perform data manipulation</strong></p>
        <p>
            Including this release, the engine loads and holds all involved <tt>CACHED</tt>
            table <tt>UPDATE</tt>, <tt>DELETE</tt> and <tt>SELECT INTO</tt> rows in physical
            memory for the duration of each query execution, including rows referenced by the
            <tt>ON {UPDATE | DELETE}</tt> clause of any <tt>FOREIGN KEY</tt> table constraints.
            This policy severely limits the
            engine's present ability to perform updates, deletes and select into inserts involving
            a large number of <tt>CACHED</tt> table rows. If possible, one's programs should
            be designed to perform such large operations by decomposing them into smaller sets.</p>
        <p>
            When executing multirow transactions, a list of all row-level insert, delete or
            update operations is stored in memory so that they can be undone when a <tt>ROLLBACK</tt>
            is issued. Hence, transactions that modify a large number of rows will also consume
            a great deal of additional memory in the transaction UNDO list until a subsequent
            <tt>COMMIT</tt> or <tt>ROLLBACK</tt> clears it.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Memory usage and the HSQLDB Value Pool</strong></p>
        <p>
            HSQLDB uses a value pool for immutable objects. Depending on the value distribution
            in one's database and query results, this may significantly reduce the upper bound
            on the runtime heap memory footprint, as it may be possible to avoid the creation
            of many object instances representing the same value.</p>
        <p>
            For example, if 100 rows were to referrence an <tt>SQL INTEGER</tt> column of a
            parent row using 100 distinct but equal valued <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt> instances,
            the resulting memory consumption would be <tt>100 * ((~12</tt> bytes per <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt>)
            + (~4 bytes per array slot)) or 1600 bytes. On the other hand, if the parent column
            value were to be retrieved from the value pool and assigned to the corresponding
            column of each child row, then the resulting memory consumption would be ~12 (bytes
            for the single, immutable <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt>) + (100 * (~4 bytes per array
            slot)) or ~412 bytes: a saving of ~1188 bytes and a reduction of memory consumption
            to ~25% that of the first case.</p>
        <p>
            Of course, if one's database holds an effectively random distribution of data, the
            benefit of a value pool is likely low or non-existent.&nbsp; In practice, value
            pool induced savings are on some order strictly less than but similar to the reciprocal of the effective
            operating data redundancy.</p>
        <h4>
            Row Buffer Memory Allocation</h4>
        <p>
            With <tt>CACHED</tt> tables, row data is stored primarily on disk, while only a fraction
            (up to a declared maximum number of rows) is held in memory at any one time, the
            default being 49152 rows as controlled by the <tt>hsqldb.cache_scale</tt> database
            property.</p>
        <p>
            In theory, limiting rows alone may not be a completely effective way of controlling
            row buffer memory allocation. For example, let there be a <tt>CACHED</tt> table
            with 100,000 rows such that 40% consume 1,000 bytes each in physical memory
            and the remaining rows consume 100 bytes each in memory. Then, given a query that
            always selects half of the rows (50,000), the worst case result set includes all
            of the larger rows ((10,000 * 100) + (40,000 * 1000) = 41,000,000 bytes), whereas
            the average case result set includes an even distribution (25000 * 100 + 25000 *
            1000 = 27,500,000 bytes). Now, let the objective be to limit row buffer memory allocation
            to no greater than 32MB by specifying an upper limit of 50,000 buffered rows. Obviously,
            this is satisfactory in the average case and, upon further analysis, will be satisfactory
            in a large majority of cases, but just as obviously is simply <em>not</em> a completely
            satisfactory solution.</p>
        <p>
            To solve such a problem, an additional property, <tt>hsqldb.cache_size_scale</tt>
            should be used in conjunction with the <tt>hsqldb.cache_scale</tt> property to enforce
            an additional limit (this time in actual bytes) on row buffer memory allocation.</p>
        <p>
            With both properties at their respective default values, the buffer manager attempts
            to limit allocation to an approximate maximum of 50MB.</p>
        <p>
            Whatever the calculated limit on allocation, the policy is enforced by comparing
            the limit against the sum of the reported size of each buffered row's binary image
            on disk, which is generally smaller than its in-memory representation.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a number of reasons, the effective maximum row buffer memory allocation may actually be several (emperically 2-4) times the
            declared limit:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Because of the discrepancy between the reported size of each buffered row's binary
                    image on disk and its in-memory represention, for instance due to the expansion
                    of UTF-8 encoded character data on disk to UTF-16 in memory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Because the buffer manager never refuses to load a requested row, instead only releasing
                    currently buffered rows to make room. As a result, the theoretical maximum is greater
                    than the calculated limit by some value between the memory required to represent
                    the largest single row in the database and the memory required to represent the
                    two largest rows in the database.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Because the row flushing policy of the current buffer manager is suboptimal.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Note that if memory is at a premium, the <tt>hsqldb.cache_scale</tt> or <tt>hsqldb.cache_size_scale</tt>
            database properties can be reduced significantly, even to <em>very</em> conservative
            values (768 rows and 64 bytes per row, a limit of ~48KB), but
            at the cost of reduced <tt>CACHED</tt> table query performance. Also note that under
            certain workloads, garbage collection and/or heap settings, &nbsp;specifying cache
            scale and/or cache size scale too high may also reduce performance due to well-known
            effects that are beyond the scope of this guide.</p>

            Managing Database Connections</h3>
        <p>
            Multiple database connections are supported in all HSQLDB operation modes</p>
        <p>
            The engine is known to work with most connection pooling software, but for In-Process operation
            it is generally superfluous. </p>
        <p>
            For network operation, connection pooling is recommended
            in order to avoid socket resource starvation under the <em>connection per request</em>
            stateless service model. However, the overhead of obtaining an HSQLDB network connection
            is currently significantly
            lower than a number of commonly used commerial DBMS, so it may not be realistic expect the same order of performance
            boost normally realized by implementing network
            connection pooling.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Typical reasons to use a connection pool:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <p>
                    To allow new queries to be performed while a time-consuming query is being performed
                    in the background. This is not possible in this release, as the engine blocks at
                    the database instance level for the duration of each request, effectively processing
                    requests in serial order. That is, the engine supports muliplexed statement execution,
                    rather than true multi-threaded concurrent statement execution, although true multi-threaded
                    operation is under development and will be introduced in a future
                    version.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To limit the maximum number of simultaneous in-process connections to the database
                    for performance reasons. With HSQLDB, tests indicate that it is possible to open
                    ~ 50,000 connection objects in a modern VM configured with 64MB maximum heap before
                    an out of memory exception is raised.&nbsp; Hence, enforcing a limit is likely to
                    be useful only if your application is designed in a way that opens a tremendous
                    number of connections, for instance by spawing a large number of threads, each of
                    which opens a large number of connections to perform a variety of small, short-running
                    tasks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To limit the maximum number of simultaneous network connections in order to avoid
                    socket resource exhaustion.&nbsp; This is an external concern and hence applies
                    to HSQLDB as much as to any other service with a socket interface.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To implement efficient transaction processing in a multi-threaded application. This
                    can be useful with HSQLDB as well. For example, a web application transaction may
                    involve some processing between database queries and/or may include a sequence of
                    user responses across page navigations and reloads. Rather than having to choose
                    between a connection per page request model (forcing the application to directly
                    implement locking, transactional accounting and possibly compensating transactions)
                    or a connection per HTTP session model (which may require an unacceptable maximum
                    number of simultaneously open connections), connections can be drawn from a pool,
                    assigned to an HTTP session for the duration of a transaction and aggressively returned
                    to the pool at the end of each transaction (whose duration may be less than the
                    duration of an HTTP request <em>or</em> the duration of an HTTP session). With a
                    pool implementation that is capable of detecting and reaping connections that are
                    deemed to have timed out due to inactivity, the best of both worlds can be achieved:
                    session-scope work is possible, is isolated and can be committed or rolled back
                    separate from the work performed in other sessions or other transactions within
                    the same session, yet connections can be resued across HTTP sessions, reducing the
                    ceiling on the maximum number of simultaneously open connections that must be supported.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            An application that is not both multi-threaded and transactional, such as an application
            for recording user login and logout actions, does not need more than one connection.
            The connection can stay open indefinitely and only needs to be reopened when it
            is dropped due to network problems.</p>

                Notes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Most virtual machines adhere to a policy that prevents allocating over some configurable
                        maximum amount of heap memory. As per the discussion of disk and memory usage above,
                        the default amount may not adequate when large memory tables
                        are used; the average size of rows in cached tables is large; transactions
                        affect a large number of rows;
                        large queries are executed. In such cases, the virtual machine settings should
                        be consulted and, if possible, must be (re)configured to accept a larger maximum.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        When using an in-process database with previous HSQLDB versions, the application
                        had to keep at least one connection to the database open, otherwise the database
                        would close automatically when the connection count transitioned from one (1) to
                        zero (0), meaning further attempts to create connections could fail.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is no longer required, as the engine implements a different policy: in the
                        current release, an explicit SHUTDOWN command is required to close a database. Note,
                        however, that the
                        "Shutdown=True;" connection property can be used by the first
                        connection to revert to the previous behavior if required.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        When using a server-hosted database (and to some extent, an in-process
                        database), care must be taken to avoid creating and dropping connections too frequently.
                        Failure to observe this may result in socket resource and/or other operating system resource exhaustion, leading
                        to unsuccessful connection attempts or general O/S or process
                        level failure when the application is under heavy load.</p>

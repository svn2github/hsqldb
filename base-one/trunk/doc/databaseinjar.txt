A patch for storing a readonly hsqldb database was contributed by Brendan Ryan
and has been incorporated into the code base after it was modified to work with
other, unrelated changes.

Brendan Ryan wrote (text changed):

I have made a small change to allow a readonly hsqldb database (.script and
.properties) to be stored in a JAR file so that it can be used with JWS.

The feature is only active when the Java property "hsqldb.files_in_jar" 
is set to "true" on the command line, and I believe the code to be quite
harmless to normal operation. A sample jnlp file is given below.

The relative location of the database as taken from the jdbc url is used.
For example, if the url is specified as "jdbc:hsqldb:testdata/felder.hsqldb"
then the database is loaded from the "testdata/" directory in the jar
and the database file names are "felder.hsqldb.properties" and
felder.hsqldb.script" in that directory.

I hope the code is useful for someone.

Brendan Ryan

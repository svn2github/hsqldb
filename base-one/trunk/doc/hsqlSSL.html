(A.k.a. SSL.)
The instructions in this document are liable to change at any time.
In particular, we will be changing the method to supply the server-side
certificate password.
<H2>Requirements</H2>
<UL>
    <LI>Java 2.x and up
    <LI>If Java 2.x or 3.x, then you will need need to
     <A href="#jsse">install JSSE</A>.
     Your server and/or client will start up much slower than that of 
     Java 4.x users.
     Client-side users will not be able to use the https: JDBC protocol
      (because the https protocol handler is not implemented in 2.x/3.x
      Java JSSE; if there is demand, we could work around this).
    <LI>A <A href="#keystore">JKS keystore containing a private key</A>, in
      order to run a server.
</UL>
<H2>Encrypting your JDBC connection</H2>
At this time, only 1-way, server-cert encryption is tested.
<P>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold">CLIENT-SIDE</SPAN>
<P>
    Just use one of the following protocol prefixes.
    <UL>
    	<LI>jdbc:hsqldb:hsqls://
    	<LI>jdbc:hsqldb:https://
    </UL>
    At this time, the latter will only work for clients running with Java 1.4.
    <P>
    If the server you wish to connect to is using a certificate approved by
    your default trust keystores, then there is nothing else to do.  If not,
    then you need to tell Java to "trust" the server cert.
    <P>
    First, you need to obtain the cert (only the "public" part of it).
    Since this cert is passed to all clients, you could obtain it by writing
     a java client that dumps it to file, or perhaps by using 
     <SPAN style="font-style: italic">openssl s_client</SPAN>.
    Since in most cases, if you want to trust a non-commercial cert, you
     probably have access to the server keystore, I'll show an example of
     how to get what you need from the server-side JKS keystore.
    <P>
    <CODE>
     keytool -export -keystore server.store -alias existing_alias -file server.cer
    </CODE>
    <P>
    What you need is the file 
    <SPAN style="font-style: italic">server.cer</SPAN>.
    Now, you need to add this cert to one of the system trust keystores
    or to a keystore of your own.
    See 
    <A href=
    "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CustomizingStores">
     the Customizing Stores section in JSSERefGuide.html</A>
     to see where your system trust keystores are.
    You can put private keystores anywhere you want to.
    The following command will add the cert to an existing keystore, or create
    a new keystore if "client.store" doesn't exist.
    <P>
    <CODE>
     keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore trust.store -alias new_alias -file server.cer
    </CODE>
    <P>
    Unless your OS can't stop other people from writing to your files, you
    probably do not want to set a password on the trust keystore.
    <P>
    If you added the cert to a system trust store, then you are finished.
    Otherwise, you will need to set the sytem property
     javax.net.ssl.trustStore every time that you run your client program.
    For example
    <P>
    <CODE>
java -cp /path/to/hsqldb.jar -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/home/blaine/trust.store org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager
    </CODE>
    <P>
    N.b.  The hostname in your database URL must match the 
    <SPAN style="font-style: italic">Common Name</SPAN> of the server's
    certificate exactly.
    That means that if a site certificate is 
    <SPAN style="font-style: italic">admc.com</SPAN>, you can not use
    <SPAN style="font-style: italic">jdbc:hsqldb:hsqls://localhost</SPAN> or
  <SPAN style="font-style: italic">jdbc:hsqldb:hsqls://www.admc.com:1100</SPAN>
    to connect to it.
    <P>
    If you want more details on anything, see JSSERefGuide.html on
    <A href=
    "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html">
    	Sun's site</A>, or in the subdirectory 
	docs/guide/security/jsse of your Java SE docs.

<P>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold">SERVER-SIDE</SPAN>
<P>
Get yourself a <A href="#keystore">JKS keystore containing a private key</A>.
Then set the system property javax.net.ssl.keyStore to the path to that file,
and javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword to the password of the keystore (and to
the private key-- they have to be the same).  Example
    <P>
    <CODE>
     java -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=secret -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/usr/hsqldb/db/db3/server.store -cp /path/to/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server -port 9005 -database /usr/hsqldb/db/db3/db3

    </CODE>
    <P>
Note that specifying a password on the command-line is definitely
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold">not secure</SPAN>.
It's really only appropriate when untrusted users do not have any
access to your computer.
Before long, we will have a more secure way to give the password.

<A name="jsse"/>
<H2>JSSE</H2>
If you are running Java 4.x, then you are all set.
Java 1.x users, you are on your own (Sun does not provide a JSSE that will
work with 1.x).
Java 2.x and 3.x users continue...
<P>
Go to <A href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/index-103.html">
http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/index-103.html</A>.
If you agree to the terms and meet the requirements, download the domestic 
or global JSSE software.
All you from the software is the three jar files.
If you have a JDK installation, then move the 3 jar files into the directory 
$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext.
If you have a JRE installation, then move the 3 jar files into the directory 
$JAVA_HOME/lib/ext.
<P>
Pretty painless.
<A name="keystore"/>
<H2>Making a Private-key Keystore</H2>
There are two main ways to do this.
Either you can use a certificate signed by a certificate authority, or
you can make your own.
One thing that you need to know in both cases is,
the <SPAN style="font-weight: bold">Common Name</SPAN> of the cert
has to be the exact hostname that JDBC clients will use in their database URL.
<P>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold">CA-SIGNED CERT</SPAN>
<P>
I'm not going to tell you how to get a CA-signed SSL certificate.
That is well documented at many other places.
<P>
Assuming that you have a standard pem-style private key certificate, here's
how you can use <A href="www.openssl.org">openssl</A> and the program
DERImport to get it into a JKS keystore.
<P>
Because I have spent a lot of time on this document already, I am just
giving you an example.
    <P>
    <CODE>
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -outform DER -in Xpvk.pem -inform PEM -out Xpvk.pk8 -nocrypt
    <BR>
    openssl x509 -in Xcert.pem -out Xcert.der -outform DER
    <BR>java DERImport new.keystore NEWALIAS Xpvk.pk8 Xcert.der
    </CODE>
    <P>
You need the program DERImport.class of course.
Do some internet searches to find DERImport.java or DERImport.class and
download it.
<P>
If DERImport has become difficult to obtain, I can write a program to do
the same thing-- just let me know.
<P>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold">NON-CA-SIGNED CERT</SPAN>

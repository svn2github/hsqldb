HSQLDB v. 1.61

Changes 20 July 2001

The following enhancements and bug fixes have been introduced:
Patch or Bug tracking numbers are included where one exists.

Compatibility with version 1.43 databases.
Database files created with 1.43 can be opened with version 1.61. The
database is converted into the 1.6x format. As a precaution against future
problems, databases created with later versions cannot be opened by this 
version(1.60 and 1.61, 1.6x are considered the same version but 1.6x and 
1.7x are different versions).

The LIMIT keyword for fetching only part of the result set.

SELECT LIMIT n m { selectExpression | table.* | * } [, ... ] .........

The LIMIT keyword can be used immediately after the SELECT keyword and has
two numbers as parameters. The query is executed as if LIMIT and its 
parameters were not present, then the rows after the offset position (n)
and specified by count (m) are returned. Offset n is counted from one.
"SELECT LIMIT 10 20 * FROM mytable" returns rows 11-30 only
Currently LIMIT cannot be used together with DISTINCT

Changes 06 July 2001


I have checked the bug reports and patches and indicated my opinion as to
which patches / bug fixes should be done for the 1.61 point release,
stating NO or OK. I have incorporated some of these and fixed one myself.
In addition, the patch for database migration from 1.43 to 1.6x that I 
submitted on 16 April should be incorporated into the point release.

There were 10 patches up to 16 April, which according to Mark, have been 
incorporated. Except:

OK-------416149 Swing interface for DatabaseManager - ok - but file is missing

Patches since 16 April:


OK-------418014 Trace specific exceptions - ok
INCORPORATED fredt

NO-------418017 Month format
		   fredt: - patch is ok - do we want this as it can break existing code

OK-------418019 Timestamp format - ok - won't break existing code
INCORPORATED fredt


OK-------418022 Char comparison
		   fredt: - patch is ok - do we want this as it can break existing code
         fredt: - now I think we should add it anyway. Side effects would be minimal.
INCORPORATED fredt


OK-------418023 SUBSTR - ok

Bugs


OK-------416138 Resolved: The user should use switchtojdk11 before the build

NO-------416139 Multiple result sets
         fredt: High Hopes?


  -------416140 PATCH for getMoreResults() - ok

ALREADY IN VERSION 1.60 fredt


OK-------416141 DatabaseMetaData.getExportedKeys() does not work :
		   fredt: I know this one from Hypersonic. May be able to fix it.

fredt: In DatabaseInformation.java, getSystemTable(,,) creates a table on the
fly for metadata information and then fills it with information from tTable.
Code has been written to fill the SYSTEM_TABLES, SYSTEM_TYPES, etc.
but not FOREIGN_KEY etc. as these would be more complicated.
I hope to get a bit of extra time in the near future to implement
this and related calls, getExportedKeys(), getCrossReference(), etc.


  -------416142 SAME AS ABOVE


OK-------416143 PATCH LONGVARBINARY - ok

ALREADY IN VERSION 1.60

OK-------416144 PATCH for GROUP BY - has side effect
  -------416146 SAME AS ABOVE

INCORPORATED fredt: fixed with different code without side effect

OK-------416325 complaint by user -
		   fredt: If they submit their changes we will incorporate into the CVS.


OK-------416357 DB transition - documentation issue - If anyone has a
         half-finished doc we can put it up and ask users / developers to
         contribute and finish it. Mike seems to have done something about this.


OK-------423114 Timestamp - Mike and Mark were looking into this.
		   fredt: If no results I can have a go.

OK-------423964 Single Quote in string fields - says it has been fixed in HQSLDB
		   fredt: has it been fixed?

??-------424027 DELETE FROM ... problem with cached tables

NO-------424767 Request for support for 0 and 1 as bit values

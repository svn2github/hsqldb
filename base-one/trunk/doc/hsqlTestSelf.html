<h2>HSQLDB Test Utility</h2>
<p>One of the test classes in HSQLDB tests various queries and operations on the 
  database. Part of this is a speed test, which can be used to get a rough estimate 
  of the speed of inserts, deletes and updates with ordinary (memory based) tables 
  and cached tables.</p>
<p>You should compile the hsqldbtest.jar with Ant to run this utility.</p>
<p>A batch file is provided in the demo directory. To start the application on 
  Windows, type: </p>
<p><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>runtest TestSelf</span></code> 
</p>
<p>To test speed by inserting 30000 rows into one table, type: </p>
<p><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>runtest TestSelf 
  30000</span></code> </p>
<p>To test inserting 10000 rows in the In-Memory-mode type only: </p>
<p><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>runtest TestSelf 
  10000 -m</span></code> </p>
<p>TestSelf will first try to insert the rows into a cached table, and then into 
  an in-memory table. The first part may work and the second part (in-memory table) 
  may run out of memory if there is not enough memory available. You may experience 
  a delay between updating and deleting records. This is by design: the recovery 
  mechanism is tested here. </p>
<h3>SQL TESTS</h3>
<p>The new version of TestSelf runs multiple SQL test files to test different operations of the database. All files in the working directory with names matching <code>TestSelf*.txt</code>  are processed in alphabetical order. This makes it easy to add new tests to the framework.</p>

<h3>hsqldb version 1.7.0 Find File sample application</h3>
This application builds a database of a directory tree and allows you to search the database.
<p> This example application is designed for programers are new to the JDBC. The 
  functionality is kept low, so it should be easy to understand what is going 
  on. It connects, execute queries and inserts data into the database. 
<p> First, the database must be initialized with a path. All the file names  in this directory 
  and all its subdirectories will be stored in the database. After this is done, 
  the database can be searched for files that match a specific pattern. 
<p>This sample
application is not compiled as part of the hsqldb jar. You should compile it yourself. You should modify the following examples to include the correct location of the hsqldb.jar in the commands.
<p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
Re-create database from directory '.':
<p> <code>java -classpath %CLASSPATH%;hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.sample.FindFile -init 
  .</code> 
<p> for convenience there is also a batch file that does the same: 
<p>
<code>run FindFile -init .</code>
<p>
Find files like 'name':
<p> <code>java -classpath %CLASSPATH%;hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.sample.FindFile name</code>

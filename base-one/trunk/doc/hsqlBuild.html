<h3>Building hsqldb version 1.7.1 and 1.7.2</h3>
From 1.7.2, in most cases you do not need to build hsqldb at all, since the supplied
hsqldb.jar file was built with Java 1.3.1 and will run with any JRE.
<h4>Building with ANT, from the Apache Jakarta Project</h4>
<p>ANT (Another Neat Tool), from the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta project</a>, is used for building hsqldb. The version currently used to test the build script is 1.5.1.</p>
<h4>Obtaining ANT</h4>
<p>Ant is a part of the Jakarta/Apache Project. </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '><strong>Go to the <a
     href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Jakarta site for ANT</a></strong><br>
    This is the index page for the ANT sub-project.. </li>

<h4><strong>Building with ANT</strong> </h4>
<p>Under the <code>/hsqldb </code>folder, in <code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>/build</span></code> 
  there is an Ant <code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>build.xml</span></code> 
  that builds the hsqldb.jar. (Ant must be already installed). To use it, change to <code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>/build</span></code> then type: </p>
<p style='font-family: monospace'>ant -projecthelp</p>
<p>This displays the available ant targets, which you can supply as
command line arguments to ant.  These include</p>
<!-- Why are we printing this table out?
     We just told the user to run "ant -projecthelp", which will give them
     an up-to-date and accurate listing for their exact version of hsqldb,
     and we don't have to update this file to keep that accurate.
     If the user is capable of using ant to make these targets, then they
     are also capable of running "ant -projecthelp" for themselves.

<p><br>
  HSQLDB can be built in any combination of five different sizes and three JRE 
  (Java Runtime Environment) versions. The smallest jar size (hsqljdbc.jar)
  contains only the Hsqldb JDBC Driver client.  The next smallest jar
  size (hsqldbmin.jar) contains only the standalone database (no servers) and 
  JDBC support and is suitable for embedded applications. The default size 
  (hsqldb.jar) also 
  contains server mode support and the utilities. The largest size (hsqldbtest.jar) includes some test 
  classes as well. </p>
<p>You need the JUnit jar in the /lib directory in order to build and run the 
  test classes.</p>
<p>A Jar file for HSQLDB is provided in the .zip package. This jar contains both 
  the database and the utilities and has been built with JDK 1.3.1. From version 1.7.2, this jar is compatible with all JDK / JRE runtime versions from 1.1.x to 1.4.</p>
<p>The preferred method of rebuilding the jar is with Ant. After installing Ant 
  on your system use the following command from the /build directory: ant The 
  command displays a list of different options for building different sizes of 
  the HSQLDB Jar. The default is built using:</p>
<p>ant jar</p>
<p>The Ant method always builds a jar with the JDK that is 
  used by Ant and specified in the JAVA_HOME environment variable. From version 1.7.2, Use of JDK 1.1.x is not recommended for building the JAR, even for running under JDK 1.1.x -- use JDK 1.3.1 for compatibility with 1.1.x - 1.4.x. Building with JDK 1.4.x will result in a jar that is not backward compatible.</p>
<p>Before building 
  the hsqldbtest.jar package, you should download the junit jar from <a href="http://www.junit.org">www.junit.org</a>  and put it in 
  the /lib directory, alongside servlet.jar, which is included in the .zip package.</p>
<h4>Building with Batch Files</h4>
<p>UNIX users must use Ant to build hsqldb.

<p>For DOS/Windows users, a set of MSDOS batch files is provided as an
  alternative to using Ant.
  These produce only the default 
  jar size. The path and classpath variables for the JDK should of course be set 
  before running any of the batch files.</p>
<p>If you are compiling for JDK's other than 1.2.x or 1.3.x, you should use the 
  appropriate switchToJDK11.bat or switchToJDK14.bat to adapt the source files 
  to the target JDK before running the appropriate buildJDK11.bat or buildJDK14.bat 
  JDK and JRE versions.</p>
<p>From version 1.7.2, Use of JDK 1.1.x is not recommended for building the JAR, even for running under JDK 1.1.x. For earlier versions, the JDK used for building the jar should generally be the same series as the 
  target. This is because the java.sql package in each version (1.1.x 1.2.x 1.3.x 
  1.4.x) has a different set of methods in its public interfaces. Javadoc can 
  be built with Ant and batch files.</p>

<h3>hsqldb version 1.7.0 Database Files and Recovery</h3>
<p>The Standalone and Client/Server modes will in most cases use files to store 
  all data to disk in a persistent and safe way. This document describes 
  the meaning of the files and the mechanisms. </p>
<p>A database named 'test' is used in this description. The database files will 
  be 'test.script', 'test.properties', 'test.data' and 'test.backup'.</p>
<h3>Database Files</h3>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.properties</strong><br>
    Contains the entry 'modified'. If the entry 'modified' is set to 'yes' then 
    the database is either running or was not closed correctly (because the close 
    algorithm sets 'modified' to 'no' at the end). </li>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.script</strong><br>
    This file contains the SQL statements that makes up the database so far (something 
    like the 'Redo-log' or 'Transaction-log', but just text) </li>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.data</strong><br>
    This file contains the (binary) data records for CACHED tables only </li>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.backup</strong><br>
    This is compressed file that contains the backup of the old test.data file. 
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Mechanisms</h3>
<p><strong>Database is opened</strong> </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>Check if test.properties file is in use (algorithm: try to 
    delete and re-create; if it works then the database it is not in use). </li>
  <li style='     '>Check in the test.properties file if 'modified=yes'. This 
    would mean last time it was not closed correctly, and thus the test.data file 
    may be corrupted. In this case the 'Repair' algorithm is executed (see below) 
    otherwise </li>
  <li style='     '>If in the test.properties file 'modified=yes-new-files', then 
    the (old) test.backup and test.script files are deleted and the new test.script.new 
    file is renamed to test.script. </li>
  <li style='     '>Open the test.script file and execute the commands </li>
  <li style='     '>Append commands to the test.script file </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Database is aborted</strong> </p>
<p>This may happen by sudden power off, Ctrl+C in Windows, but may be simulated 
  using the command SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY. </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>All files are closed; but the test.script file contains all 
    information to re-do all changes. </li>
   <li style='     '>The test.data file may be corrupt because the cache in memory 
    was not written completely. </li>
  <li style='     '>The test.properties still containes 'modified=yes' </li>
  <li style='     '>All files are closed (maybe by the operating system) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Database is closed correctly</strong> </p>
<p>This may be done using the command SHUTDOWN, in the Standalone version using 
  Connection.close() </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>The test.data file is written completely </li>
  <li style='     '>The test.backup.new is created (containing the compressed 
    test.data file) </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.script.new is created using the information 
    in the database (and thus shrinks because no 'update' and 'delete' statements; 
    only simple 'inserts'). </li>
  <li style='     '>The entry 'modified' is set to 'yes-new-files' </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.script is deleted </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.script.new is renamed to test.script </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.backup is deleted </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.backup.new is renamed to test.backup </li>
  <li style='     '>The entry 'modified' is set to 'no' </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Repair</strong> </p>
<p>The current test.data file is corrupt, but with the old test.data (from the 
  test.backup file) and the current test.script, the database can be made up-to-date: 
</p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>Restore the old test.data file from the backup (uncompress 
    the test.backup) </li>
  <li style='     '>Execute all commands in the test.script file. </li>
  <li style='     '>Close the database correctly (including a backup). </li>
</ul>

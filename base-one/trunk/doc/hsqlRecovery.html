<h2>HSQLDB Database Files and Recovery</h2>
<p>The Standalone and Client/Server modes will in most cases use files to store 
  all data to disk in a persistent and safe way. This document describes 
  the meaning of the files, the states and the procedures followed by the engine to recover the data. </p>
<p>A database named 'test' is used in this description. The database files will 
  be 'test.script', 'test.properties', 'test.data' and 'test.backup'.</p>
<h3>Database Files</h3>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.properties</strong><br>
    Contains the entry 'modified'. If the entry 'modified' is set to 'yes' then 
    the database is either running or was not closed correctly (because the close 
    algorithm sets 'modified' to 'no' at the end). </li>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.script</strong><br>
    This file contains the SQL statements that makes up the database up to the last checkpoint - it is in synch with test.backup</li>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.data</strong><br>
    This file contains the (binary) data records for CACHED tables only </li>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.backup</strong><br>
    This is compressed file that contains the complete backup of the old test.data file at the time of last checkpoint. </li>
  <li style='     '><strong>test.log</strong><br>
    This file contains the extra SQL statements that have modified the database since the last checkpoint (something 
    like the 'Redo-log' or 'Transaction-log', but just text) 
    <p>In the above list, a checkpoint results from both a CHECKPOINT command and a SHUTDOWN command.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>States</h3>
<p><strong>Database is closed correctly</strong> </p>
<p>This is the state after using the command, SHUTDOWN</p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>The test.data file is fully updated</li>
  <li style='     '>The test.backup contains the compressed 
    test.data file</li>
  <li style='     '>The  test.script contains  the information 
    in the database, excluding data for CACHED and TEXT tables. </li>
  <li style='     '>The test.properties contains the entry 'modified'  set to 'no' </li>
  <li style='     '>There is no test.log  file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Database is closed correctly with SHUTDOWN SCRIPT</strong></p>
<p>This is the state after using the command, SHUTDOWN SCRIPT</p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>The test.data file does not exist; all CACHED table data is in the test.script file</li>
  <li style='     '>The test.backup does not exist.</li>
  <li style='     '>The  test.script contains  the information 
    in the database, including data for CACHED and TEXT tables.</li>
  <li style='     '>The test.properties contains the entry 'modified'  set to 'no' </li>
  <li style='     '>There is no test.log  file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Database is aborted</strong> </p>
<p>This may happen by sudden power off, Ctrl+C in Windows, but may be simulated 
  using the command SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY. </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>The test.properties still containes 'modified=yes' </li>
  <li>The test.script contains a snapshot of the database at the last checkpoint and is OK</li>
  <li style='     '>The test.data file may be corrupt because the cache in memory 
    was not written out completely. </li>
  <li>The test.backup file contains a snapshot of test.data that corresponds to test.script</li>
  <li style='     '>The  test.log file contain all 
    information to re-do all changes since the snanapshot. As a result of abnormal termination, this file may be partially corrupt. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
The database engine performs the following procedures internally in different 
circumstances. 
<p><strong>When the database is closed correctly</strong> </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>The test.data file is written completely (all the modified 
    cached table rows are witten out) and closed</li>
  <li style='     '>The test.backup.new is created (containing the compressed 
    test.data file) </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.script.new is created using the information 
    in the database (and thus shrinks because no UPDATE and DELETE statements; 
    only INSERT). </li>
  <li style='     '>The entry 'modified' in the properties file is set to 'yes-new-files' 
  </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.script is deleted </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.script.new is renamed to test.script </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.backup is deleted </li>
  <li style='     '>The file test.backup.new is renamed to test.backup </li>
  <li style='     '>The entry 'modified' in the properties file is set to 'no' 
  </li>
  <li>The file test.log is deleted</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Database is opened</strong> </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>Check if the database files are in use (by checking a sepecial 
    test.lck file).</li>
  <li>See if the test.properties file exists, otherwise create it.</li>
  <li>If the test.properties did not exist, then this is a new database. Create 
    the empty test.log to append new commands.</li>
  <li style='     '>If it is an existing database, check in the test.properties 
    file if 'modified=yes'. This would mean last time it was not closed correctly, 
    and thus the test.data file may be corrupted or incomplete. In this case the 
    'REPAIR' algorithm is executed (see below), before the database is opened 
    normally.</li>
  <li style='     '>Otherwise, if in the test.properties file 'modified=yes-new-files', 
    then the (old) test.backup and test.script files are deleted and the new test.script.new 
    file is renamed to test.script. </li>
  <li style='     '>Open the test.script file and execute the commands </li>
  <li>Create the empty test.log to append new commands</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Repair</strong> </p>
<p>The current test.data file is corrupt, but with the old test.data (from the 
  test.backup file and test.script) and the current test.log, the database is made up-to-date. The database engine takes these steps:</p>
<ul type=disc>
   
  <li style='     '>Restore the old test.data file from the backup (uncompress 
    the test.backup and overwrite test.data) </li>
  <li style='     '>Execute all commands in the test.script file. </li>
  <li>Execute all commands in the test.log file. If due to corruption, an exception 
    is thrown, the rest of the lines of command in the test.log file are ignored.</li>
  <li style='     '>Close the database correctly (including a backup).</li>
</ul>

# N.b.  Being a system script, this script does not use inherited variables.
# If you want to adjust a setting, edit the config file.


# Strategy of this init script is to avoid shell-specific functionality,
# and use only lowest-common-denominator Bourne capabilities.
# We don't include OS-specific functions, and we don't use shell-
# implementation-specific functionality like "echo ...\c" or "echo -n...".
# Since some Bourne shells don't support shell functions at all, we don't
# even define any local functions.

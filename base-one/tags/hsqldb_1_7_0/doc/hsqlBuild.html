<h3> Building hsqldb version 1.7.0</h3>
<h4>Building with ANT, from the Apache Jakarta Project</h4>
<p>ANT (<u>A</u>nother <u>N</u>eat <u>T</u>ool), from the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta 
  project</a>, is used for building hsqldb. Thanks go out to the Apache/Jakarta and ANT teams for giving the 
  world such a wonderful tool. Additional links to ANT info can be found on the 
  <a href="internet/hSqlLinks.html">Links Page</a>.</p>
<h4>Obtaining ANT</h4>
Ant is a part of the Jakarta/Apache Project. 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Go to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Jakarta 
    site for ANT</a></strong><br>
    This is the index page for the ANT sub-project.. 
    <p> 
  <li><strong>Go to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/">Installing 
    ANT page</a> and follow the dirctions for your platform </strong><br>
      <p> 
</ul>
<h4><strong>Building with ANT</strong> </h4>
<p>In <code>/build</code> there is an Ant <code>build.xml</code> that builds the hsqldb.jar. (Ant must be 
  <br>
  already installed). To use it, change to <code>/build</code>  then type: </p>
<p>ant</p>
<p>This displays the command line options which include</p>
<table width="75%" border="1">
   <tr>
      <td>ant jar </td>
      <td>to make the hsqldb.jar</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ant clean</td>
      <td>to clean up the /classes 
  directory that is created</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ant cleanall</td>
      <td>to remove the old 
  jar as well</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ant javadoc</td>
      <td>to build javadoc</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ant jarmain</td>
      <td>to build a smaller jar for hsqldb that does not contain utilities</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ant jartest</td>
      <td>to build a larger jar for hsqldb that contains tests</td>
   </tr>
</table>
<p><br>
   HSQLDB can be built in any combination of three different sizes and
three JRE (Java Runtime Environment) versions. The smallest jar size (hsqldbmain.jar) contains only the database
and JDBC support. The default size (hsqldb.jar) also contains the
utilities. The largest size (hsqldbtest.jar) includes some test
classes as well. </p>
<p>You need the JUnit jar in the /lib directory in
order to build and run the test classes.</p>
<p>A Jar file for HSQLDB is provided in the .zip package. This jar
contains both the database and the utilities and has been built
with JDK 1.3.1.

If you want to run HSQLDB with JRE version 1.1.x you should rebuild
the jar.</p>
<p>The preferred method of rebuilding the jar is with Ant. After
installing Ant on your system use the following command from the
/build directory:

ant

The command displays a list of different options for building 
different sizes of the HSQLDB Jar. The default is built using:</p>
<p>ant jar</p>
<p>The Ant method always builds a Jar that is compatible with the
JDK that is used by Ant and specified in the JAVA_HOME environment
variable.

Before building the hsqldbtest.jar package, you should download the
junit.jar and put it in the /lib directory, alongside servlet.jar, 
which is included in the .zip packabe.</p>
<h4>Building with Batch Files</h4>
<p>A set of MSDOS batch files is also provided. These produce only
the default jar size. The path and classpath variables for the JDK
should of course be set before running any of the batch files.</p>
<p>

If you are compiling for JDK's other than 1.2.x or 1.3.x, you should
use the appropriate switchtoJDK11.bat or switchtoJDK14.bat to adapt
the source files to the target JDK before running the appropriate
buildJDK11.bat or buildJDK14.bat

JDK and JRE versions.</p>
<p>

The JDK used for building the jar should generally be the same series
as the target. This is because the java.sql package in each version
(1.1.x 1.2.x 1.3.x 1.4.x) has a different set of methods
in its public interfaces.

Javadoc can be built with Ant and batch files.</p>

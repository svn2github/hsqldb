<h2>RUNNING HSQLDB COMPONENTS AND TOOLS</h2>
<p>The HSQLDB jar package consists of several programs: </p>
<p>HSQLDB RDBMS</p>
<p>HSQLDB JDBC Driver</p>
<p>Database Manager (Swing and AWT versions)</p>
<p>Transfer Tool (Swing and AWT versions)</p>
<p>Query Tool (AWT)</p>
<p>Script Tool</p>
<p>The HSQLDB RDBMS and JDBC Driver provide the core functionality. The rest are general-purpose database tools that can be used with any database engine that has a JDBC driver.</p>
<h3>RUNNING TOOLS</h3>
<p>All tools can be run in the standard way for archived Java classes. In the following example the AWT version of the Database Manager, the hsqldb.jar is located in the directory ../lib relative to the current directory.</p>
<pre>java -classpath %CLASSPATH%;../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager</pre>
<p>If hsqldb.jar is in the current directory, the command would change to:</p>
<pre>java -classpath %CLASSPATH%;hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager</pre>
<p>The list of main classes for the tools are follows:</p>
<pre>org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager</pre>
<pre>org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing</pre>
<pre>org.hsqldb.util.Transfer</pre>
<pre>org.hsqldb.util.TransferSwing</pre>
<pre>org.hsqldb.util.QueryTool</pre>
<pre>org.hsqldb.util.ScriptTool</pre>
<p>Some tools, such as the Database Manager or Script Tool, can use command line arguments or entirely rely on them. You can add the command line argument -? to get a list of available arguments for these tools. Database Manager and Transfer Tool feature a graphical user interface and can be explored interactively.</p>
<h3>RUNNING HSQLDB</h3>
<p>HSQLDB can be run in a number of different ways. In general these are divided into Server Modes and In-Process Mode (also called Standalone Mode). A different sub-program from the jar is used to run HSQLDB in each mode.</p>
<p>Each HSQLDB database consists of between 2 to 4 files, all named the same but with different extensions, located in the same directory. For example, the database named &quot;test&quot; consists of the following files:</p>
<pre>test.properties<br>test.script<br>test.data<br>test.backup
</pre>
<p>The properties files contains general settings about the database. The script file contains the definition of tables and other database objects, plus the data for non-cached tables. The data file contains the data for cached tables and the backup file is a zipped backup of the last known consistent state of the cache. All these files are essential and should never be deleted. If a database has no cached tables, the test.data and test.backup files will not be present. In addition to those files, HSQLDB database may link to any formatted text files, such as CSV lists, anywhere on the disk.<br>
   <br>
</p>
<h3>SERVER MODES</h3>
<p>Server Modes provide the maximum accessibility. The database engine runs in a JVM and listens for connections from programs on the same computer or other computers on the network. Several different programs can connect to the server and retrieve or update information. Applications programs (clients) connect to the server using the HSQLDB JDBC driver. In all server modes, the server serves only one database that is specified at the time of running the server. If you need to provide connectivity to several databases, you should run several instances of the server each on a different port.</p>
<p>There are three server modes, based on the protocol used for communications between the client and server.</p>
<h4>HSQLDB Server</h4>
<p>This is the preferred way of running a database server and the fastest one. A proprietary communications protocol is used for this mode. A command similar to those used for running tools and described above is used for running the server. An example of the command for starting the server is:</p>
<pre>java -classpath %CLASSPATH%;hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database mydb</pre>
<p>The command line argument -? can be used to get a list of available arguments.</p>
<h4>HSQLDB Web Server</h4>
<p>This is used when access to the computer hosting the database server is restricted to the HTTP protocol. The HSQLDB Web Server is a special web server that allows JDBC clients to connect via HTTP. As the HTTP protocol is stateless, connections to a web server do not have a persistent session. This limits the range of actions that can be performed on the database. Each time you issue a JDBC command, it is treated as a new connection to the database. As a result transactions cannot be rolled back.</p>
<p>The main classes for the server is:</p>
<pre>org.hsqldb.WebServer</pre>
<p>The command line argument -? can be used to get a list of available arguments.</p>
<h4>HSQLDB Servlet</h4>
<p>This uses the same protocol as the Web Server and has the same limitations. It is used when a separate servlet engine (or application server) such as Tomcat or Resin provides access to the database. The Servlet Mode cannot be started independently from the servlet engine. The hsqlServlet class, in the HSQLDB jar, should be installed on the application server to provide the connection. The database is specified using an application server property. Refer to the source file hsqlServlet.java to see the details.</p>
<p>Both Web Server and Servlet modes can only be accessed using the JDBC driver at the client end. They do not provide a web front end to the database.</p>
<h4>Connecting to a  Databases Running as Server</h4>
<p>Once an HSQLDB server is running, client programs can connect to it using the HSQLDB JDBC Driver contained hsqldb.jar. Full information on how to connect to a server is provided in the Java Documentation for jdbcConnection.java (located in the /doc/src directory of HSQLDB distribution. A common example is connection to the default port (9001) used for the hsql protocol on the same machine:</p>
<pre>Class.<b>forName</b> ( "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver" );
Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>Note in the above connection URL, there is no mention of the database (file) as this was specified when running the server.</p>
<h3>IN-PROCESS	 (Standalone) MODE</h3>
<p>This mode runs the database engine as part of your application program in the same Java Virtual Machine. For some applications this mode can be faster, as the data is not converted and sent over the network. The main drawback is that it is not possible to connect to the database from outside your application. As a result you cannot check the contents of the database with external tools such as Database Manager while your application is running. The recommended way of using this mode in an application is to use an HSQLDB Server instance for the database while developing the application and then switch to In-Process mode for deployment.</p>
<p>An In-Process Mode database is started from JDBC, with the database file path specified in the connection URL. For example, if the database name is testdb and its files are located in the same directory as where the command to run your application was issued, the following sequence is used for the connection:</p>
<pre>Class.<b>forName</b> ( "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver" );
Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:testdb", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>The database file path format can be specified using forward slashes in Windows hosts as well as Linux hosts. So relative paths or paths that refer to the same directory on the same drive can be identical. For example if your database path in Linux is /opt/db/testdb and you create an identical directory structure on the C: drive of a Windows host, you can use the same URL in both Windows and Linux:</p>
<pre>Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:/opt/db/testdb", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>Refer to Javadoc for jdbcConnection.java for more details.</p>
<h4>Memory Only Databases</h4>
<p>It is possible to run HSQLDB in a way that the database is not persistent and exists entirely in random access memory. As no information is written to disk, this mode should be used only for internal processing of application data, in applets or certain special applications. This mode is specified by using a dot "." as the database file path.</p>
<pre>Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:.", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>(You can also run a memory only server instance by specifying a dot as the name of the database. This usage is not common and is limited to special applications.)</p>
<h4>Closing the Database</h4>
<p>All databases running in different modes can be closed with the SHUTDOWN command, issued as an SQL query. In-process databases are closed also when the last connection to the database is explicitly closed via JDBC. When SHUTDOWN is issued, all active transactions are rolled back. A special form of closing the database is via the SHUTDOWN COMPACT command. This command rewrites the .data file that contains the information stored in CACHED tables and compacts it  to size. This command should be issued periodically, especially when lots of inserts, updates or deletes are performed on the cached tables. Changes to the structure of the database, such as dropping or modifying tables or indexes also create large amounts of unused space that can be reclaimed using this command.</p>
<h3>USING THE DATABASE ENGINE</h3>
<p>Once a connection is established to a database in any mode, JDBC methods are used to interact with the database. The Javadoc for jdbcConnection, jdbcDriver, jdbcDatabaseMetadata, jdbcResultSet, jdbcStatement and jdbcPreparedStatement list all the supported JDBC methods together with information that is specific to HSQLDB. JDBC methods are broadly divided into: connection related methods, metadata methods and database access methods. The database access methods use SQL commands to perform actions on the database and return the results either a Java primitive type or as an instance of the java.sql.ResultSet class.</p>
<p>You can use Database Manager or other Java database access tools to explore your database and update it with SQL commands. These programs use JDBC internally to submit your commands to the database engine and to display the results in a human readable format.</p>
<p>The SQL dialect used in HSQLDB is as close to the SQL92 standard as it has been possible to achieve so far in a small footprint database engine. The full list of SQL commands is in hsqlTextTable.html.</p>
<h4>Different Types of Table</h4>
<p>HSQLDB supports TEMP tables and three types of persistent tables.</p>
<p>TEMP tables are not written to disk and last only for the lifetime of the Connection object. Each TEMP table is visible only from the Connection that was used to create it; other concurrent connections to the database will not have access to the table.</p>
<p>The three types of persistent tables are MEMORY tables, CACHED tables and TEXT tables.</p>
<p>Memory tables are the default type when the CREATE TABLE command is used. Their data is held entirely in memory but any change to their structure or contents is written to the &lt;dbname&gt;.scipt file. The script file is read the next time the database is opened, and the MEMORY tables are recreated with all their contents.</p>
<p>CACHED tables are created with the CREATE CACHED TABLE command. Only part of their data is held in memory, allowing large tables that would otherwise take up to several hundred megabytes of memory. Another advantage of cached tables is that the database engine takes less time to start up when a cached table is used for large amounts of data. The disadvantage of cached tables is a reduction in speed. Do not use cached tables if your data set is relatively small.</p>
<p>TEXT tables are new to version 1.7.0 and use a CSV (Comma Separated Value) or other delimited text file as the source of their data. You can specify an existing CSV file, such as a dump from another database or program, as the source of a TEXT table. Alternatively, you can specify an empty file to be filled with data by the database engine. TEXT tables are efficient in memory usage and faster than CACHED tables. Two commands are needed to set up a TEXT table as detailed in hsqlTextTables.html document.</p>
<h4>CONSTRAINTS and INDEXES</h4>
<p>HSQLDB supports PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY constraints. In addition it supports UNIQUE or ordinary indexes. This support is fairly comprehensive and covers multi-column constraints and indexes, plus cascading deletes for foreign keys.</p>
<p>HSQLDB creates indexes internally to support PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY constraints: a unique index is created for each PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint; an ordinary index is created for each FOREIGN KEY constraint. Because of this, you should not create duplicate user-defined indexes on the same column sets covered by these constraints. This would result in unnecessary memory and speed overheads.

<h2>hsqldb version 1.7.0 Test Utility</h2>
<p>One of the test classes in HSQLDB tests various queries and operations on the database. Part of this is a speed test which can be used to get a rough estimate of the speed of inserts, deletes and updates with ordinary (memory based) tables and cached tables.</p>
<p>You should compile the hsqldbtest.jar using Ant to run this utility.</p>
<p>A  batch file is provided in the demo directory.
To startup the application on Windows type:
</p>
<p>
<code>runtest TestSelf</code>
<p>
To test inserting 30000 rows into one table, type:
<p>
<code>runtest TestSelf 30000</code>
<p>
To test inserting 10000 rows in the In-Memory-mode type only:
<p>
<code>runtest TestSelf 10000 -m</code>
<p>
SelfTest will first try to insert the rows into a cached
table, and then into an in-memory table. The first part
may work and the second part (in-memory table) may run out 
of memory if there is not enough memory available. You may
experience a delay between updating and deleting records. 
This is by design: the recovery mechanism is tested here.

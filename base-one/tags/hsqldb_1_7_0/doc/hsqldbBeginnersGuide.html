</ul><a class=heading name=intro>INTRODUCTION </a>This document is written 
by <a href="mailto:blaine.simpson@admc.com">Blaine Simpson</a> of <a 
href="http://admc.com/">Axis Data Management Corp</a>. Distribute freely. Email 
me if you have any criticisms, suggestions, corrections, additions, etc. Even if 
you are only running hsqldb embedded in another product, I recommend that you 
work through this document so that you will understand hsqldb enough to use it 
effectively. 
<p>I believe that everything in this document applies to versions 7.x of hsqldb. 

<p>In order to make my examples brief, in most cases I just provide the UNIX 
usage. If you are a Windows user, you may need to change forward slashes to 
back-slashes and rework quotes and line-continuations to satisfy your command 
shell. This unfairness is offset somewhat by the complete disregard of 
non-Windows platforms in hsqldb-supplied documentation. 
<p>My tact is to avoid hsqldb <i>scripts</i> altogether. For one thing, hsqldb 
only supplies scripts for Windows. For another, the build scripts are broken for 
Linux (1.7.0rc5) , and they explicitly recommend using the Ant build procedure. 
The developers apparently don't want you to use their scripts in a production 
setting, because they put the scripts into $HSQLDB_HOME/demo instead of 
$HSQLDB_HOME/bin. But, most importantly, running the Java commands from the 
command line gives you a real understanding of how hsqldb works. For example, if 
you run <i>cd ../demo; ./runWebServer</i> (assuming it is available for your 
platform), you may have no idea that you are actually instantiating a Java 
instance of org.hsqldb.WebServer from the hsqldb.jar file. Assuming that you 
have a basic understanding of Java, if you run the Java commands directly, you 
will know exaclty what is happening and will gain insights into how you can set 
up hsqldb for your specific needs. <a 
href="mailto:%20blaine.simpson@admc.com">Email me</a> if you have a need for 
UNIX versions of the build scripts and scripts in $HSQLDB_HOME/demo, and I will 
convert them. 
<p>For some commands I show how to specify optional arguments. When I do, I use 
square brackets [like this] around the optional argument(s). You do not type the 
square brackets, and you can omit the entire [expression] completely. 
<ul>TODO

name=definitions>DEFINITIONS </a>These definitions are purely stipulative and 
are made for the purpose of making this document easy to understand. 
<p><b>dataset identifier</b> 
<p>I hereby define "dataset identifier" to be the root filename of the database 
files for any database. By root filename, I mean the part of the database 
filenames before the . + extension (this is the only part of the filename that 
they all have in common). The exceptional case of a memory-only database has a 
dataset name of ".", by (my) definition. 
<p><b>$HSQLDB_HOME</b> 
<p>The base directory in which hsqldb lives (this is not necessariliy where your 
data or databases reside). 
<p><b>NODENAME</b> 
<p>A name that your <i>resolver</i> can resolve to an IP address. This could be, 
for example, a hostname, the name of floating IP address, <i>localhost</i>, or a 
dotted-quad IP address string like 127.0.0.1. <a class=heading 
name=install>INSTALLING HSQLDB </a>Go to <a 
href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/">http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/</a> and 
poke around (I don't want to be too specific because they may change things 
around). Download the zip or archive for the version of hsqldb that you want. 
Extract the zip/tar file to wherever you want the hsqldb system to reside (the 
$HSQLDB_HOME). The contents of production hsqldb archives contain a 
version-specific base directory (like <i>hsqldb_v.1.61</i>) as is customary. 
However, at least some non-production archives do not contain a base directory 
(i.e., the contents are all <b>relative</b> to an unnamed $HSQLDB_HOME base 
directory). So, after you download the archive, do a <i>unzip -v</i> or <i>tar 
-tzf</i>. If there is no base directory, then mkdir one and cd to it before 
extracting with <i>unzip</i>, <i>tar -xzf</i>, etc. 
<p>Look through $HSQLDB_HOME/readme.txt and/or $HSQLDB_HOME/index.html. (They 
may or may not be there, depending on whether you are working with a production 
release, etc.). The most important file of the hsqldb system is hsqldb.jar, 
which resides at $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar. Your index.html or readme.txt file 
should say what version of Java your hsqldb.jar was built with/for. If they 
don't say, or it is not your JRE version, then I suggest that you rebuild 
hsqldb.jar to avoid problems due to JRE version conflicts. 
<div class=red>The supplied build scripts do not work for me unless the Ant 
build has run first. It produces a bunch of errors indicating that Java 
interfaces are not being satisfied, and it results in an incomplete hsqldb.jar 
file. Therefore, I recommend that you stick to the Ant build, even if this means 
you have to download and install yet another application. 
<p>I am told that this problem does not occur in Windows. </p></div>If you don't 
already have Ant, download any recent production version from <a 
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Apache's Jakarta site</a>, cd to where you 
want Ant to live, and extract from the archive with <i>unzip</i> or <i>tar 
-xzf</i>. 
<p>cd to $HSQLDB_HOME/build. Make sure that the bin directory under your Ant 
home is in your search path. Make sure that you set the environmental variable 
JAVA_HOME to the base directory of your Java JRE or SDK. (like "<code>export 
JAVA_HOME; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0</code>" in UNIX, or "<code>set 
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\J2re1.4.0</code>" in Windows). Run the following 
command. 
<blockquote><code>ant jar</code></blockquote>This builds 
$HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar. <a class=heading name=architecture>HSQLDB 
ARCHITECTURE </a>Database files, when there are any, reside in the directory you 
were in when you issued the Java command that started the database engine 
(starting the Server, or the Tools in the case of Standalone engines). Four of 
the files consist of the dataset identifier ("test" is used as the identifier in 
this exmple) and an extension. Example: <pre>    test.data
    test.script
    test.properties (in some cases)
    test.backup (in some cases)
    server.properties (in some cases)
    webserver.properties (in some cases)
</pre>The exception to the claim about the files residing in the startup 
directory is when the dataset identifier consists of an absolute file path (less 
the filename extensions), instead of just a base filename. For example, 
<i>/home/databases/test</i> or <i>C:/TEMP/DBS/test</i> instead of just 
<i>test</i>. In that case, the directory is determined by the path given. <a 
class=heading name=running>RUNNING HSQLDB </a>Add $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar to 
your $CLASSPATH. In perhaps the majority of cases, you will have no pre-existing 
$CLASSPATH, and will want only the hsqldb classes and the current directory (in 
order to run your own .class files, etc.) in your classpath. In this trivial 
case, the command in UNIX would be 
<blockquote><code>export CLASSPATH; 
  CLASSPATH=$HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar:.</code></blockquote>(substitute your real 
$HSQLDB_HOME, unless you have really set the environmental variable). 
<p><span class=bold>TOOLS</span> 
<p>You can use DatabaseManager or QueryTool with any hsqldb database (assuming 
that you can reach it). (I refer to QueryTool and DatabaseManager below as 
<i>the Tools</i>) I am writing the Java commands as single long lines because I 
don't know how wide your browser window is. Be aware that your browser may be 
folding these single commands into multiple lines (you can check it out by 
streteching your browser really wide). You can, of course, use any shell 
functionalities to break any given command into multiple lines. Don't forget to 
add $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar to your $CLASSPATH as explained above. These 
examples use the sample URL jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://skipper.admc.com. 
<blockquote><code>java org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager ['-?'] [-url 
  jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://skipper.admc.com]</code> 
  <p>(Don't forget to refresh the tree after data changes). IMPORTANT: Choose 
  your Engine type FIRST, because this will change the URL field! 
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><code>java org.hsqldb.util.QueryTool ['-?'] [-url 
  jdbc:hsqldb:hsql:] [-database //skipper.admc.com]* [-test false] </code>
  <p>(Loads up a goofy query by default that in most cases has no relationship 
  to your data) Beware that you need to use "-test false" if you don't want to 
  add test data to your target database. The url arg is actually the URL 
  up-to-and-including the last colon. The database arg is actually just the last 
  part of the URL, which, in the case of Server engines, is not a dataset 
  identifier. </p></blockquote>These samples show what I consider to be the most 
widely useful options-- there are other options too. Use the '-?' to get a 
syntax message. Note that they run in the foreground, so "&gt; /somewhere 
2&gt;&amp;amt;1 &amp;" if you want your shell back. 
<p>Default data sources (if you don't give an Applet property of "database" and 
do not give a command-line argument). 
<ul>
  <li>QueryTool defaults to the in-memory database ".". 
  <li>DatabaseManager has no default. It gives you a nice chooser. 
</li></ul>Specify database with Applet param of ".", arg of -database for 
QueryTool, full -url for DatabaseManager (you can't just give the db to 
DatabaseManager). 
<p><span class=bold>HSQL Engine Modes</span> 
<p>The data source <i>URL</i> is dependent on the Engine Mode, but the data 
source <i>Driver</i> is not. The data source Driver is always <span 
class=bold>org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver</span>. 
<ul>
  <li><span class=bold>In-Memory</span><br>URL format: jdbc:hsqldb:. <br>No 
  persistence. An applet, for example, could have his very own database running 
  in his memory. There is no daemon. Database uses no network resources. 
  <div class=red>For some reason, with in-memory database ".", sometimes you get 
  default data and sometimes you don't. You get the data with QueryTool on the 
  command-line, and with DatabaseManager from Applet. Otherwise you get an empty 
  database. file:/path/to.file.html) </div>
  <li><span class=bold>Standalone Engine</span><br>URL format: 
  jdbc:hsqldb:DATASET (where DATASET is the dataset identifier) <br>Uses files 
  only. No daemon. Just connect with DatabaseManager (or your client code) and 
  it will access the files directly. Database uses no network resources. 
  <li><span class=bold>Server Engine</span> and <span class=bold>WebServer 
  Engine</span><br>URL format: jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://NODENAME[:port] (port defaults 
  to 9001) <br>and<br>URL format: jdbc:hsqldb:http://NODENAME[:port] (port 
  defaults to 80) <br>Server STARTUP COMMAND:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java 
  org.hsqldb.Server ['-?'] [-port X] [-database DATASET]</code><a 
  href="#footnote">*</a> 
  <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;(where DATASET is the dataset identifier) <br>WebServer 
  STARTUP COMMAND:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java org.hsqldb.WebServer ['-?'] [-port 
  X] [-database DATASET]</code><a 
  href="#footnote">*</a> 
  <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;(where DATASET is the dataset identifier) 
  <p>These startup commands show what I consider to be the most widely useful 
  options-- there are other options too. Daemon runs in foreground (just like 
  the tools). Listens to port 9001/tcp (80 for Web) by default. (tools and apps 
  connect up to this) Shut down with Interrupt signal, or "shutdown" command 
  with either tool. 
  <div class=red>IMPORTANT: With Web/Server engines, the dataset identifier is 
  only used by the server daemon to name his data files. The clients use a URL 
  ending in a NODENAME or NODENAME:port to locate the data daemon. You can not 
  run more than one dataset on one port. </div>WebServer-specific stuff. The 
  hsqldb WebServer is a lame HTTP/1.0 web server, but for POSTS, instead of 
  posting to a CGI, username + password + statement are passed to DB and 
  executed. Query results are returned. You can give settings in a file named 
  webserver.properties in the directory in which the WebServer will be started 
  up. Note that the WebServer engine listens to port 80 by default, and this 
  requires superuser privileges. So, if you are not root, you will need to 
  change the port by using the appropriate argument to <i>java WebServer...</i> 
  or webserver.properteis setting, then use the :port suffix in your data source 
  URLs. </li></ul><span class=bold>Resources</span> Do check out the docs in 
$HSQLDB_HOME/doc. 
<p><a name=footnote>*</a> Note the ambiguity with database arguments between 
QueryTool and Server. QueryTool url arg always ends with : (which is dumb if you 
ask me), and the database starts with / for Servers engines. <i>java 
Server...</i> and <i>java WebServer...</i> database arg is just the dataset 
identifier, like "test". <a class=heading name=flatfiles>CHARACTER DELIMITED 
FLAT DATABASE FILES </a>For database engines other than In-Memory engines, you 
can have specific tables use a text-char-delimited table-specific file to store 
the data. 
<p>Specific <i>tables</i> may be <i>text tables</i>. You can not change the 
default mode so that <i>CREATE TABLE</i> commands will create text tables. You 
must use the special <i>CREATE TEXT TABLE</i> command to create a text table (or 
use the special SELECT command described below). 
<blockquote><code>CREATE TEXT TABLE mynewtable...</code></blockquote>
<p>At this point, the table is read-only and can not store data, because there 
is no file associated with the text table. 
<blockquote><code>SET TABLE mynewtable SOURCE 
"filename.csv"</code></blockquote>Now you are all set. The default delimiter is 
"<b>,</b>". You can change that by specifying it along with the text file like 
<blockquote><code>SET TABLE mynewtable SOURCE 
"filename.csv;fs=|"</code></blockquote>where <it>fs</it> means Field Separator. 
This and several other useful settings can be made either with the SET TABLE 
command or in your datasource properties file (like "test.properties"). 
<p>To create a new text table from the definition and data of an existing normal 
table, use a command like 
<blockquote><code>SELECT * INTO TEXT newtable FROM existingtable 
</code></blockquote>The file name is created automatically (I don't know why the 
behavior of the SELECT...INTO command is so radically different from the CREATE 
command). The filename is a lower-cased and normalized version of the table name 
plus suffix "csv". The file will reside in the same directory as the other 
database files. 
<p>My tests show that the text file is not updated upon commits (at least with a 
Standalone database engine). The files got updated when I exited my client tool. 
It is likely that the files get updated upon <i>disconnect</i>. This is of 
concern if you are using some other method to view the data files (perhaps 
viewing them interactively or accessing them with a non-hsqldb such as a 
non-Java app or inside a JNLP routine). 
<p>(Note that you will get a null pointer exception stack trace if you give an 
SQL disconnect command before exiting the tools. Don't worry about it. 
Everything continues to work fine. hsqldb bug id #561284) 
<div></div><a class=heading name=tidbits>TIDBITS </a>This stuff will eventually 
make it into documents under $HSQLDB_HOME/doc. Please do <a 
href="mailto:blaine.simpson@admc.com">tell me</a> if something here <i>is</i> 
documented under $HSQLDB_HOME/doc. 
<p>By default, in hsqldb, VARCHAR, LONGCHAR and CHAR are completely equivalent. 
(Therefore I will speak of them here simply as CHAR). I don't know the size 
limitation, but I have successfully stored and retrieved 2M in single 
reads/writes of CHAR fields (my JVM ran out of RAM after that and I haven't 
taken the time to repeate the test with more JVM resources). </p>

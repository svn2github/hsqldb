  <h2>HSQLDB Development</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>Hypersonic SQL was an open-source all-Java database engine, first released 
    with source in 1998. It started from a simple memory-only database but by 
    the year 2000 and version 1.43 it had developed into a fully fledged SQL engine 
    with an avid following.</p>
  <p>When the Hypersonic SQL project was closed, a number of developers who were 
    using the software for their work got together through the Internet and formed 
    the HSQLDB Development Group. The membership covers four continents. The Group 
    released the first version of HSQLDB (1.60) in April 2001, featuring support 
    for SQL triggers and other enhancements. The next version (1.61) followed 
    in July that year.</p>
  <p>Growing interest in HSQLDB resulted in more and more enhancements and new 
    features submitted to the project. Development continued for the next 12 months 
    and the next version, 1.7.0, was released with major new functionality. Version 
    1.7.1 followed in October 2002 with further enhancements.</p>
  <p>The work on version 1.7.2 had already started when 1.7.1 was released. This 
    process continued until July 2004 when 1.7.2 was finally released after extensive 
    alpha and beta testing. In this version we aimed to modularize the existing 
    code as we added new features. In this effort, we have covered several core 
    classes and will continue towards a fully modular code base for future versions.</p>
  <p>Development work on 1.7.3 is being carried out now.</p>
  <h3>The Development Team</h3>
  <p>Most developers contribute to this project when they have some free time 
    or when the projects they are working on needs a particular database feature. 
    New developers join us from time to time and some of those who have previously 
    made major code contributions are no-longer active due to professional commitments. 
    The development effort is coordinated by the Maintainer to ensure continuity 
    and to avoid duplication of effort as much as possible. </p>
  <p>We are always looking for new developers to join our team. Anyone who contributes 
    code or documentation is welcome to join. Please send an email to the Maintainer, 
    Fred Toussi, <b>fredt (at) users.sourceforge.net</b> with your proposed 
    enhancement or join the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hsqldb-developers">Developers 
    Mailing List </a>and post there. Archives of the list are at <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/hsqldb-developers@lists.sourceforge.net/">Developers 
    Mailing List Archive</a></p>
  <p>Help is currently needed in several areas for the future versions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementation of updatable views and result sets</li>
    <li>New index types and implementation of GIST</li>
    <li>Implementation of different levels of transaction isolation</li>
    <li>Design and implementation of a grammar based parser</li>
    <li>Tests and documentation on compiling HSQLDB for PDA and similar devices</li>
    <li>More extensive test framework</li>
    <li>Work on connectors written in C, C++ or other languages to access HSQLDB 
      from languages other than Java</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Co-ordination with Users</h3>
  <p>HSQLDB is used in (or is supported by) a large number of open source projects. 
    We welcome direct, priority contact with developers from those projects to 
    ensure a smooth transition to new versions. We also value contributions from 
    all other developers who use HSQLDB in their projects. We have been able to 
    fulfil many requests for additional features or bug fixes and will continue 
    to give priority to what users ask for. Users who want to contribute enhancements 
    can post the code to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=23316&amp;atid=378133">Patch 
    Tracker</a> or alternatively discuss it in the Developers Mailing List or 
    directly with the Maintainer.</p>
  <h3>Some Details</h3>
  <p>The <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/hsqldb/hsqldb">hsqldb 
    CVS module</a> contains only the files of public releases. Ongoing development 
    is reflected in the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/hsqldb/hsqldb-dev/">hsqldb-dev 
    CVS module</a>. Developers can all commit changes to this module.</p>
  <p>The outline plan for the new features in version 1.7.3, as well as broader 
    discussions on the direction of the project can be found in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=73673">Open 
    Discussion Forum</a>.</p>

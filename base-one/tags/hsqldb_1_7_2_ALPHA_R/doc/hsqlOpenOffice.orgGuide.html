<h2>RUNNING HSQLDB with OpenOffice.org<br>
</h2>
<h4>Introducion<br>
</h4>
<p>HSQLDB can now act as a Database with OpenOffice.org. This document
is written to help you connecting and running HSQLDB out of
OpenOffice.org in a simple way. Without user-managment and only for
your single-system. <br>
If you have problems read the other available documents, because
I&nbsp; will not write them here again. If you need a real DB-System
with user-management and different rights for different users, read the
other  documents.
</p>
<h4>Installing</h4>
<p>I assume you have a running OpenOffice.org (OOo) and a
JavaRuntimeEnvironment. So place the hsqldb-1.7.2.*.zip file where you
want on your disk and unpack it 
(I assume you have done this already).</p>
<h4>Setting up OpenOffice.org</h4>
<p>
Start OOo with a text document and go to the Database-Explorer (simpy
by pressing F4).
In the left frame you see a tree-view with all known databases in
OOo.<br>
A right mouse-click opens a menu where you can manage  your
databases.
So click on *New Database* and choose a name that you want to have inside
 OOo.
I chose HSQLDB as name. <br>
As connection-type choose JDBC and then
switch
to the JDBC-tab. <br>
As Driver-Class insert org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver and as
URL choose the following:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On windows:</span> you can specify a
directory where HSQLDB should store the
info and data. Something
like jdbc:hsqldb:c:\javasrc\hsqldb-dev\databasename (where jdbc: is
written by OOo).
the string c:\javasrc\hsqldb-dev\databasename works only on windows,
but you can write this down
as linux-path like /javasrc/hsqldb-dev/databasename too. Then HSQLDB
takes the c:\ drive
as root. This means this works only on c:\ for you.<br>
The first is the directory-path and the databasename is the identifier
for the database.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On Linux:</span> choose a path as said
for windows like /opt/db/data <br>
As username take sa, this is the standard-administrator for HSQLDB.<br>
Now click the OK-Button</p>
<p>Now OOo has to find your hsqldb.jar file.<br>
So go to options =&gt; security and insert the path to the .jar file.
If you have problems, search the Online-help for JDBC. You then get
help in your own language (this is generally quite better than my English, I
think ;-)</p>
<p>Next we tell OOo to ignore the DriverPrivileges because on our
single-user-system we do not need them. <br>
So we go to http://dba.openoffice.org and look at the
IgnoreDriverPrivileges.html file
in the HowTo-section. You find here a macro-code. <br>
Open tools =&gt; macro in OOo to get the Basic-IDE. Here simple copy
and paste the code and run the macro.
You see a input-box where you only have to insert the name of your DB,
in my example I have to insert HSQLDB, because I took this as name in
OOo. <br>
Note that if you change your OOo-DB name, you have to run this macro
again!</p>
<br>
<p>Now we only have to stop and restart OOo. Be sure that you exit
Quickstarter and all running processes too. On next OOo-Start you
should have a running Database in OpenOffice.org</p>

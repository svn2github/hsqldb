  <hr>
  <br>
  <h3>How to install and run HSQLDB</h3>
  <p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Download the hsqldb.zip file in the download page to your local computer. 
    <li>Uncompress the files. Any program that can handle zip files should work 
      If you have trouble uncompressing the file and have installed a JDK you 
      may also use the command line tool jar: open a command prompt, change to 
      the directory where the file hsqldb.zip is, and type: <br>
      jar -xf hsqldb.zip 
    <li>You need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) 
      to run HSQLDB. 
    <li>Browse the documentation included in the hsqldb folder. Start with 'index.html'.<br>
      <a name="RUNANDCOMPILE"></a> 
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>How to compile HSQLDB</h3>
  <p> A compiled JAR of HSQLDB is included in the download. This runs under JRE 
    1.4 or later. If you want to re-compile for other JDK's, you will need a Java 
    compiler. See the documentation in the /build directory. 
  <p> Command line compiler tools are included in the free <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">JDK 
    (Java Development Kit) from Sun</a>. 
  <p> <a name="NEWDB"></a> 
  <hr>
  <h3> How to create a new database </h3>
  <p> A new database is created automatically if it does not yet exist. Just connect 
    to the not-yet-existing database using the jdbc:hsqldb:file:&laquo;database-path&raquo; 
    URL (should replace the last part with the path you want) with the user 'sa' 
    and an empty password. 
  <p> <a name="START"></a> 
  <hr>
  <h3>How to start programming JDBC / HSQLDB</h3>
  <p> HSQLDB comes with documentation, example applets and source code that can 
    help programers who are new to JDBC programming. 
  <p> An example application is in the guide. Another example is FindFile.java 
    in the /src/org/hsqldb/sample folder. This is a tool to search files. The 
    source code of this demo application is well documented, and the functionality 
    is kept low, so it should be easy to understand what is going on just reading 
    the source code. 
  <p> Because the source code of all other tools and applets is also included 
    in the download, more advanced programmers will find some hints there. Check 
    the sources in /src/org/hsqldb/sample and /src/org/hsqldb/test folders. 
  <p> <a name="DOCUMENTATION"></a> 
  <hr>
  <h3>Where to get more Documentation</h3>
  <p> HSQLDB has a standard JDBC interface that is supported by most databases. 
    The JDBC interface is well documented in the JDK. Additionally, HSQLDB specific 
    JDBC documentation is included in the /doc/src folder. 
  <p> There are also many books available on JDBC programming. 
  <p> For people who are interested in the database engine design of HSQLDB, the 
    source code is where to look. 
  <p> <a name="JBUILDER"></a> 
  <hr>
  <h3>How to use HSQLDB inside JBuilder, Eclipse, etc.</h3>
  <p> To use HSQLDB at design-time in JBuilder, Eclipse or other tools, you usually 
    require the plug-in for databases that comes with the development environment. 
    You usually need to add a reference to the HSQLDB jar to the environment. 
    Also you normally need to register the JDBC driver (which is part of the hsqldb.jar) 
    with the environment. 
  <p> <a name="UPGRADE"></a> 
  <hr>
  <h3>How to upgrade from an old version to the current version</h3>
  <p> An old version database can always be opened by the latest version and automatically 
    converted if there is no CACHED table data in the database (the *.data file 
    is empty or does not exist). 
  <p> It is often possible to open old databases with CACHED tables too. But sometimes 
    a manual upgrade is necessary. The upgrade can be done like this. 
  <p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Backup the old database. 
    <li>Create a script of the old database with the old tools. Run the command: 
      SCRIPT 'newdb.script' in the DatabaseManager of the old database version. 
    <li>Install the new version of HSQLDB. 
    <li>Run the Database Manager of the new version and connect to a new database 
      named 'newdb'. Then issue the SHUTDOWN command. Copy the 'newdb.script' 
      file that was saved by the old version of the software over the 'newdb.script' 
      file of the new database. Then open the 'newdb'. The script file will be 
      executed automatically by the new HSQLDB and new *.properties and *.data 
      files will be created. 
    <li>If there are compatibility issues arising from non-standard database definition 
      in the old version, the new version of HSQLDB will report an error. You 
      should close Database Manager before manually editing the newdb.script to 
      remove the errors. 
  </ul>
  <p>Databases created with versions before 1.7.0 could have issues such as those 
    listed below. Such errors are not accepted by 1.7.2:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>duplicate column names in one table</li>
    <li>duplicate index or constraint name within the whole database</li>
    <li>lack of a unique constraint in the parent table of a foreign key</li>
    <li>existence of NULL values in primary key columns</li>
    <li>use of SQL keywords as table or column identifiers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that an upgrade is a one-way process, so please always keep a backup 
    of the old database.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p> 
  <ul>
    <li>How does HSQLDB compare to other RDBMS engines in SQL support / JDBC support 
      <p>HSQLDB has very extensive support for SQL 92, 99 and 2003. This support 
        is not full but is in some respects better than many other products. JDBC 
        support is good and extends to real prepared and batch statements, full 
        metadata reporting on database objects and result sets.</p>
    <li>How does HSQLDB compare to other RDBMS engines in speed 
      <p></p>
      This is something that you can measure. Overall, HSQLDB is comparable in 
      speed to non-java open-source RDBMS engines. It is generally much faster 
      than java open-source engines in most operations. You can use the performance 
      tests supplied with HSQLDB. One test, JDBCBench.java is a standard TPC-B 
      implementation that measures speed and reliablility of multi-threaded access. 
      Another test, TestCacheSize.java, is a single-threaded test for speed of 
      INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT operations with hundreds of thousands 
      of rows. Some comparisons have been posted by users in our mailing list. 
      Any specific SELECT query speed issues can normally be resolved with slight 
      modifications to the query or by adding appropriate indexes. See the Guide 
      for details.<br>
      <br>
    <li> How solid is HSQLDB 
      <p>HSQLDB 1.7.2 has undergone several months of extensive user tests with 
        over 10,000 downloads of the Release Candidate versions. This includes 
        extensive SQL compatibility tests and stress tests by application vendors 
        who use HSQLDB in their products. All the reported issues were fixed before 
        the final release and no serious issue has been reported since the release. 
        If any new issue arises, it will be dealt with promptly. Reported problems 
        since the original releas have been fixed promptly in revisions.</p>
    <li>How solid is HSQLDB when a machine crashes<br>
      <br>
      HSQLDB employs a redo log for data recovery. All the changes to the database 
      are reflected in this log. Extensive user tests have demonstrated this mechanism 
      to be effective and fail-safe in most cases. For added security, you can 
      backup the database files while the engine is running.<br>
      <br>
    <li>Can HSQLDB handle multithreading? 
      <p> The core engine is currently not multithreaded (*), but it is multithreading-safe. 
        The Server is multithreading and responds to requests while any database 
        core is busy. Application that are multithreading can use the database, 
        but all requests are executed one after the other per database, this means 
        only one at a time. This model contributes to speed, reliability, and 
        completely avoids issues such as deadlocks (*). There is a separate timer 
        thread for saving the transaction log to disk. Server modes also use threads 
        to respond to connection request. 
      <p> 
    <li> What are the limitations of the database (size of columns, number of 
      tables, rows...)? 
      <p> There is no imposed limitation. Number of columns, tables, indexes, 
        size of columns and so on is limited only by the memory. For example, 
        a user reported using a SELECT statement with 41 LEFT OUTER JOIN clauses 
        on a huge database for a data mining application. 
      <p> 
    <li> My database runs out of memory / How much memory does a database need? 
      <p> If only memory tables (CREATE TABLE or CREATE MEMORY TABLE) are used 
        then the database is limited by the memory. A minimum of bout 100 bytes 
        plus the actual data size are required for each row. If you use CREATE 
        CACHED TABLE, then the size of the table is not limited by the memory 
        beyond a certain minimum size. The data and indexes of cached tables are 
        saved to disk. With text tables, indexes are memory resident but the data 
        is cached to disk. 
      <p> 
    <li> What is the biggest known HSQLDB database? 
      <p> With previous versions tests had been made with 4,000,000 records using 
        the SelfTest (TestSelf) application (insert, update, delete). The size 
        of the database was then over 400 MB. For this tests the main memory was 
        limited to 16 MB. The current size limit of an HSQLDB database is 2 GB 
        (the biggest integer value) for all CACHED tables, 2GB for each TEXT table 
        and less than 2GB for all memory tables. Extensive tests have been made 
        with the latest versions using the TestCacheSize application inserting 
        millions of rows and resulting in data files of over 1 GB. 
      <p> 
    <li> May I use HSQLDB in a commercial product? 
      <p> Yes. HSQLDB is Open Source and free to use in any commercial product 
        so long as the terms of the Licenses are met. The Licenses of HSQLDB and 
        Hypersonic SQL (on which HSQLDB is based) are both based on the new BSD 
        License. 
      <p> 
    <li> After the program is finished, almost all statements are in the *.log 
      file, and the *.data file is almost empty. Why? 
      <p> If data has been added to CACHED tables then the database was not shut 
        down properly. When you restart the database, the *.log file will be processed 
        and an automatic checkpoint will be performed. No commited data will be 
        lost. <br>
        <br>
        The statements that make up the database are saved in the *.script file 
        (mostly CREATE statements and INSERT statements for memory tables). Only 
        data of cached tables (CREATE CACHED TABLE) are stored in the *.data file. 
        Also all data manipulation operations are stored in the *.log file (mostly 
        DELETE/INSERT) for crash recovery. When the SHUTDOWN or CHECKPOINT command 
        is issued to a database, then the *.script file is re-created and becomes 
        up-to-date. The .log file is deleted. The *.data file is also closed and 
        backed up as the *.backup file. When the database is restarted, all statements 
        of the *.script file are executed first and new statements are appended 
        to the .log file as the database is used. <br>
        <br>

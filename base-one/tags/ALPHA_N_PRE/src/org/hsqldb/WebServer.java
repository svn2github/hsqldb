/**
 *  WebServer acts as an HTTP server and is one way of
 *  using the client / server mode of HSQL Database Engine. This server can
 *  deliver static files and can also process database queries. An applet
 *  will need only the JDBC classes to access the database. The WebServer
 *  can be configured with the file 'webserver.properties'. This is an
 *  example of the file:
 *
 * <pre>
 * server.port=80
 * server.database=test
 * server.root=./
 * server.default_page=index.html
 * server.silent=true
 *
 * .htm=text/html
 * .html=text/html
 * .txt=text/plain
 * .gif=image/gif
 * .class=application/octet-stream
 * .jpg=image/jpeg
 * .jgep=image/jpeg
 * .zip=application/x-zip-compressed
 * </pre>
 *
 *  Root: use / as separator even for DOS/Windows, it will be replaced<BR>
 *  Mime-types: file ending must be lowercase<BR>
 *
 * @since 1.x
 * @version 1.7.2

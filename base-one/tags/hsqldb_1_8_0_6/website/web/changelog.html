  <p>HSQLDB 1.7.2 CHANGE LOG</p>
  <p><br>
    The development of 1.7.2 began in late 2002 with a plan to release the new 
    version within 6 months. Several alpha versions, culminating in ALPHA_M, were 
    released in the first three months and featured most of the intended enhancements. 
    However, when newly written code for system tables was introduced, many changes 
    had to be made to internal code to accommodate the reporting requirements. 
    This was followed from around April 2003 with efforts to separate query compilation 
    from execution. Other developments to allow multiple databases, better query 
    processing, more advanced SQL keywords, etc. took place simultaneously, resulting 
    in an extended scope for 1.7.2 and extensive addition and rewrite of several 
    key classes. The next alpha version was released in September, followed by 
    a further six, until the first Release Candidate became available at the end 
    of 2003. Since then, all efforts have been focused on fixing bugs and inconsistencies, 
    with 7 additional Release Candidates issued.</p>
  <p>As a result, 1.7.2 features major changes to the database engine. Existing 
    applications that work with previous versions may need modifications to work 
    with the new version. Changes are listed here and in the rest of the documentation.</p>
  <p>I would like to thank all developers, testers and users who have contributed 
    to this effort.</p>

    ----------------------------------------------------<br>
    ----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>SQL ENHANCEMENTS AND CHANGES</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------</p>
  <p>DDL</p>
  <p>Some new restrictions have been imposed:</p>
  <p>CONSTRAINT names must be unique within each database (same with INDEX names).<br>
    Size / precision / scale values for several types are now disallowed. Allowed 
    types are: CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), DOUBLE(n), DECIMAL(n,m)</p>
  <p>In column default value specification, functions such as CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_DATA, 
    etc. should not be enclosed in quotes. New function CURRENT_USER can also 
    be used.</p>
  <p>SQL keywords are not allowed as table or column names unless they are double-quoted. 
  </p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>VIEW</p>
  <p><br>
    View definitions can now have a column name list:</p>
  <p>CREATE VIEW &lt;viewname&gt; [(&lt;colnmae&gt;, ...)] AS SELECT ....</p>
  <p>ALTER TABLE commands take into account the views that reference the table 
    and prevent illegal changes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>CHECK</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Support for CHECK constraints that apply to the modified/inserted row only. 
    This can be added via ALTER TABLE ADD CHECK() or in table definition.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>QUERY PROCESSING</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Query processing has been extensively enhanced in this release and better 
    SQL standard compliance has been achieved. Major implications of the recent 
    changes are as follows:</p>
  <p>Columns in correlated subqueries are resolved independently first. If there 
    is an unresolved column, then the surrounding context is used to resolve it. 
    This is opposite the resolution order previously enforced in the engine.</p>
  <p>Some ambiguities and errors in ORDER BY clauses are now caught.</p>
  <p>UNION and other set queries accept only one ORDER BY clause at the end. In 
    this clause, column indexes or column names in the first select are allowed 
    as sort specification e.g.:</p>
  <p>SELECT .. UNION SELECT .. ORDER BY 1 DESC, 5, 3</p>
  <p>The implemntation of UNION, EXCEPT and INTERSECT set operations has been 
    rewritten to comply with SQL standards.</p>
  <p>When multiple set operations are present in a query, they are now evaluated 
    from left to right, with INTERSECT taking precedence over the rest.</p>
  <p>It is now possible to use parentheses around multiple (or single) select 
    statements with set operations to change the order of evalation.E.g.:</p>
  <p>((SELECT * FROM A EXCEPT SELECT * FROM B) INTERSECT SELECT * FROM D UNION 
    SELECT * FROM E)</p>
  <p>The above applies to all cases where a SELECT can be used except a single 
    value select inside another select. Eg.</p>
  <p>SELECT a, b, SELECT asinglevalue FROM anothertable WHERE ..., FROM atable 
    JOIN ... </p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>IMPROVEMENTS TO UPDATE AND INSERT</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Certain types of UPDATES and INSERTS that previously failed due to blanket 
    application of UNIQUE constraints now work.</p>
  <p>Examples include UPDATE ... SET col = col + 1 where col is an identity column 
    or INSERT a self referencing row under FOREIGN key constraints.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>AGGREGATES, GROUP BY, HAVING</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>DISTINCT aggregates are now supported.</p>
  <p>Aggregates on all numeric type columns are now supported. Expressions are 
    allowed as aggregate function parameter.</p>
  <p>SUM returns a BIGINT for TINYINT, SMALLINT and INTEGER columns. It returns 
    a DECIMAL for BIGINT columns (scale 0). SUM of a DECIMAL column has the same 
    scale as the column.</p>
  <p>AVG returns the same type as the column or the expression in its argument.</p>
  <p>Aggregates with GROUP BY do not return any rows if table is empty</p>
  <p>Fully enforced GROUP BY rules including support for HAVING conditions</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------</p>
  <p>JOINS</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Extensive rewrite of join processing abolishes the requirement for an index 
    on any joined columns.</p>
  <p>Problems with OUTER and INNER joins returning incorrect results have been 
    fixed and results are correct in all cases.</p>
  <p>When two tables are joined, rows resulting from joining null values in the 
    joined columns are no longer returned.</p>
  <p>Most expressions are supported in the join condition (JOIN &lt;table&gt; 
    ON ....).</p>
  <p>Outer join conditions can now include most comparison operators, as well 
    as OR logical operators. For example:</p>
  <p>LEFT OUTER JOIN atable ON a=b AND c&gt;d OR a=2 ...</p>
  <p>Illegal forward table references are no longer allowed in join conditions.</p>
  <p>There are many other small improvements and fixes, including:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>NULLS</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Support for multiple rows with null fields under unique constraints.</p>
  <p>Exclusion of NULL values from results of queries with range conditions. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>FOREIGN KEY</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Full support for triggered actions, including foreign keys that reference 
    the same table.</p>
  <p>FORIEGN KEY ... ON UPDATE { CASCADE | SET NULL | SET DEFAULT } ON DELETE 
    { CASCADE | SET NULL | SET DEFAULT }</p>
  <p>Strict treatment of foreign key constraint requirements is now enforced. 
    A foreign key declaration _requires_ a unique constraint to exist on the columns 
    of the referenced table. This applies both to old and new databases. Duplicate 
    foreign keys (with exactly the same column sets) are now disallowed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>SEQUENCE</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Support for sequences. Identity columns are now automatic sequence primary 
    key columns that can be defined as INTEGER or BIGINT as follows:</p>
  <p>GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (START WITH &lt;n&gt;, INCREMENT BY &lt;m&gt;)</p>
  <p>Named sequence objects can be defined with:</p>
  <p>CREATE SEQUENCE &lt;sequencename&gt; [AS {INTEGER | BIGINT}] [START WITH 
    &lt;startvalue&gt;] [INCREMENT BY &lt;incrementvalue&gt;];</p>
  <p>And the next value can be retrieved with the following expression in SELECT, 
    INSERT and UPDATE queries:</p>
  <p>NEXT VALUE FOR &lt;sequencename&gt;</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>SQL FUNCTIONS</p>
  <p><br>
    Added support for a range of SQL style functions:</p>
  <p><br>
    CASE .. WHEN .. THEN .. [WHEN .. THEN ..] ELSE .. END</p>
  <p>CASE WHEN .. THEN .. [WHEN .. THEN ..] ELSE ... END</p>
  <p>NULLIF(.. , ..)</p>
  <p>SUBSTRING(.. FROM .. FOR ..)</p>
  <p>POSITION(.. IN ..)</p>
  <p>TRIM( {LEADING | TRAILING .. } FROM ..)</p>
  <p>EXTRACT({DAY | TIME |..} FROM ..)</p>
  <p>COALESCE(.. , ..)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>TRIGGER</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It is now possible to execute triggers in the main execution thread. This 
    allows uses for triggers that were not possible before, especially checking 
    and modifying inserted values.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>DATETIME</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Fixed the TIMESTAMPS, TIME and DATE normalisation issues.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>OTHER</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>IN value lists can now contain column values or expressions. See TestSelfQueries.txt 
    for an example.</p>
  <p><br>
    LIKE has been debugged and optimised when possible.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------<br>
    ----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>JDBC ENHANCEMENTS</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>JDBC support for savepoints.</p>
  <p>Support for JDBC batch execution with multiple-results. Both Statement and 
    PreparedStatement batch modes are supported.</p>
  <p>SSL support for server mode operation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>CONNECTION PROPERTY</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A new property, ifexists={true|false} can be specified for connections. It 
    has an effect only on connections to in-process databases. The default is 
    false and corresponds to current behaviour. </p>
  <p>If set true, the connection is opened only if the database files have already 
    been created -- otherwise no new database is created and the connection attempt 
    will fail. Example:</p>
  <p>jdbc:hsqldb:hsql:file:mydb;ifexists=true</p>
  <p>This property is intended to reduce problems resulting from wrong URL's which 
    get translated to unintended new database files. It is recommended to use 
    this property for troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>Database properties can be specified for the first connection to a new file: 
    or mem: database. This allows properties such as enforce_strict_size to be 
    specified for mem: databases, or for a new file: database.</p>
  <p>jdbc:hsqldb:hsql:mem:test;sql.enforce_strict_size=true</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>PREPARED STATEMENTS</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Support for real PreparedStatements - major speedup.</p>
  <p>Bug fixes ensure date / time, java object and binary values stored in in-process 
    databases via prepared statements will not be altered if the object is modified 
    outside the engine.</p>
  <p>Full support for ResultSetMetaData</p>
  <p>Full support for ParameterMetaData</p>
  <p>Support for CLOB methods in ResultSet</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>TRANSACTIONS VIA WEB SERVER</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Uniform support for transactions via HSQL and HTTP (WebServer and Servlet) 
    protocols</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------------------------------------------<br>
    ----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>OTHER ENHANCEMENTS</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>SPEED</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Speed optimisation of joins with views and subqueries, using indexes to optimise 
    join performance.</p>
  <p>Improved index use for multiple key joins.</p>
  <p>Further speed improvements in all logged modes</p>
  <p>INSERT and UPDATE ops are faster by 5-20% in MEMORY tables, less in CACHED 
    tables.</p>
  <p>General speedup of CACHED table operation due to better management of the 
    memory cache.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>DATABASE PACKAGING AND MODES</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Two new options for databases: files_readonly and files_in_jar were added:</p>
  <p><br>
    FILE READ-ONLY</p>
  <p><br>
    If the property hsqldb.files_readonly=true is set in the database .properties 
    file, no attempt is made to write the changes to data to file. Default, MEMORY 
    tables can be read/write but TEXT and CACHED tables are treated as read-only.</p>
  <p><br>
    FILES IN JAR</p>
  <p><br>
    This option allows database files to be distributed in the application jar. 
    We have changed the original contribution so that a special URL is used for 
    this mode in the form of:</p>
  <p>jdbc:hsqldb:res:&lt;path in jar&gt;</p>
  <p>The URL type 'res' determines that the path that follows is a path into the 
    JAR. The path must be all lowercase and begin with a forward slash.</p>
  <p>The database can be readonly or files_readonly, depending on the value set 
    in .properties file.</p>
  <p><br>
    'OTHER' DATA TYPE</p>
  <p><br>
    Change to handling of OTHER columns. It is no longer required that the classes 
    for objects stored in OTHER columns to be available on the path of an HSQLDB 
    engine running as a server. Classes must be available on the JDBC client's 
    path.</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>MULTIPLE IN-MEMORY AND SERVER DATABASES</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Support for multiple memory-only databases within the same JVM</p>
  <p>Support for simultaneous multiple servers on different ports, multiple internal 
    connections and multiple databases within the same JVM</p>
  <p>Each HSQLDB server or webserver can now serve up to 10 different databases.</p>
  <p>The server.properties and webserver.properties method for defining the databases 
    has changed. The following properties should be used:</p>
  <p>server.database.0 path_of_the_first_database<br>
    server.dbname.0 alias_for_the_first_database</p>
  <p>Up to 10 databases can be defined but they must start from 0. The same applies 
    to command line arguments for Server and WebServer.</p>
  <p>The URL's for connecting to servers should have the alias of the database 
    at the end. For example, to connect to the HSQL protocol server on the localhost 
    use:</p>
  <p>jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/alias_for_the_database</p>
  <p>where alias_for_the_database is the same string as defined in server.properties 
    as server.dbname.n</p>
  <p>If not explicitly set, the default for server.dbname.0 is &quot;&quot; (empty 
    string) so that old URL types continue to work.</p>
  <p>Multiple memory-only database are supported by the use of:</p>
  <p>jdbc:hsqldb:mem:alias_for_the_first_database<br>
    jdbc:hsqldb:mem:alias_for_the_second_database</p>
  <p>Examples: jdbc:hsqldb:mem:db1 jdbc:hsqldb:mem:mydb</p>
  <p>The connection type, 'file:', can be used for file database connections. 
    Example below:</p>
  <p>jdbc:hsqldb:file:mydb;ifexists=true</p>
  <p>The URL for connecting to a Servlet HTTP server must have a forward-slash 
    at the end. Servlet serves only one database.</p>
  <p>jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:8080/servlet/HsqlServlet/</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>DATABASE METADATA</p>
  <p><br>
    System table support and java.sql.DatabaseMetadate have been overhauled.</p>
  <p>Use SELECT * FROM SYSTEM_TABLES to see the full list.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>TEXT TABLES</p>
  <p><br>
    Enhanced TEXT table handling and reporting of errors in CSV (source) files</p>
  <p>TEXT TABLES encoding of the source file can now be specified. UTF-8 and other 
    encodings can be used.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>MEMORY USE AND OBJECT POOLING</p>
  <p><br>
    An Object pool has been incorporated. This reduces memory usage to varying 
    degrees depending on the contents of database tables and speeds up the database 
    in most cases. Currently the size of the pool is hard-coded but it will be 
    user adjustable in a future version.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>PERSISTENCE</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------</p>
  <p>CHECKPOINT DEFRAG</p>
  <p>Defragments the *.data file without shutting down the database</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------</p>
  <p>SET SCRIPTFORMAT {TEXT | BINARY | COMPRESSED }</p>
  <p>Changes the format of the *.script file and performs a checkpoint.</p>
  <p>Database script can be stored in binary or compressed binary formats, resulting 
    in smaller size and faster loading.</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------</p>
  <p>The *.script file now contains only the DDL and data that is written at CHECKPOINT 
    or SHUTDOWN. The COMPRESSED format has the side benefit of hiding the DDL 
    and the admin password.</p>
  <p>The *.log file now contains the statements executed since the last startup 
    or CHECKPOINT. This file is in plain text format.</p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>SET WRITE_DELAY {TRUE | FALSE}</p>
  <p>SET WRITE_DELAY &lt;n&gt;</p>
  <p>The behaviour of SET WRITE_DELAY has changed with the introduction of the 
    sync() method to force the log to be written out completely to disk at given 
    intervals.</p>
  <p>SET WRITE_DELAY {TRUE | FALSE} is interpreted as synch every 60 seconds or 
    1 second. SET WRITE_DELAY &lt;n&gt; where n is an integer is interpreted as 
    synch every n seconds. The current default is 60 seconds which seems to provide 
    the right balance. Under heavy INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE test conditions, the performance 
    impact of SET WRITE_DELAY 1 is probably about 15% over that of SET WRITE_DELAY 
    300.</p>
  <p>Crash recovery has been modified so that any line in the *.log file that 
    is not properly written (and causes an error) ends the redo process. A message 
    is reported to the user, instead of stopping engine operation.</p>
  <p>----------------</p>
  <p>NIO ACCESS FOR *.data FILES</p>
  <p>New nio access layer for .data files speeds up most CACHED TABLE related 
    operations very significantly. 90% speedups in TestCacheSize tests have been 
    observed.</p>
  <p>There must be enough available memory in the machine to allow a memory-mapped 
    buffer for the entire *.data file. Beyond this size, the engine reverts to 
    non-nio access.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>BUILD</p>
  <p>Reduction in JDK / JRE dependencies (see readmebuild.txt)</p>
  <p>The supplied JAR is now compiled with JDK 1.4 and requires a JRE 1.4 or later 
    to work. You can rebuild the JAR with JDK 1.3.x in order to use it with JRE 
    1.3 or earlier.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>DOCUMENTATION</p>
  <p><br>
    Documentation is now maintained mainly in XML format with HTML and PDF versions 
    available.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>UTILITIES</p>
  <p><br>
    The SQL Tool is a powerful new utility in 1.7.2 and allows processing SQL 
    commands via the shell or scripts.</p>
  <p>The Transfer Tool utility saw a major upgrade just before the 1.7.2 release 
    cycle. In this release some minor updates and bug fixes, together with significant 
    speedup, have been intoduced.</p>
  <p>The Database Manager has been enhanced slightly to include a command to save 
    the result set in CSV format. The Swing version of Database Manager allows 
    the user to sort the rows of the result set on any column.</p>
  <p>The connection dialogue in the AWT version of Database Manager and Transfer 
    Tool allows saving and recalling connection URL's together with the user name 
    and password.</p>
  <p><br>
    ----------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>END<br>
  </p>
  <p>======================================================================================</p>
  <p>HSQLDB version 1.7.1 CHANGELOG SINCE VERSION 1.7.0</p>
  <p>Version 1.7.1 improves performance and fixes several bugs that have come 
    to light since the release of 1.7.0. It does not feature any major new functionality 
    in the database engine.</p>
  <p>*Over ten-fold speedup of function calls in queries introduced in 1.7.1.</p>
  <p>*Up to 30% reduction in memory used by indexes and table rows, resulting 
    in smaller overall memory footprint in 1.7.1.</p>
  <p>*Linux scripts for starting and shutting down server instances in 1.7.1.</p>
  <p>* Build</p>
  <p>Linux build scripts in 1.7.1</p>
  <p>======================================================================================</p>
  <p>HSQLDB version 1.7.0 CHANGELOG</p>
  <p>* Enhancements to SQL</p>
  <p>LIMIT and TOP keywords</p>
  <p>The LIMIT keyword was introduced in 1.61 with limited functionality. In 1.7.0 
    the functionality has been fully extended:</p>
  <p>SELECT LIMIT &lt;n&gt; &lt;m&gt; DISTINCT is now allowed.</p>
  <p>SELECT LIMIT &lt;n&gt; &lt;m&gt; ... is now treated as a complete SELECT 
    statement and can be used anywhere a SELECT is used, so statements such as 
    the following return meaningful results:</p>
  <p>SELECT LIMIT &lt;n&gt; &lt;m&gt; ... WHERE &lt;x&gt; IN (SELECT LIMIT &lt;o&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; ... )</p>
  <p>SELECT LIMIT &lt;n&gt; &lt;m&gt; ... UNION SELECT LIMIT &lt;o&gt; &lt;p&gt;</p>
  <p>TOP &lt;m&gt; is synonymous with LIMIT 0 &lt;m&gt;</p>
  <p>GROUP BY keyword</p>
  <p>GROUP BY had several problems and bugs that have now been resolved. The results 
    are now correct regardless of the order of selected columns or when sorting 
    by multiple columns.</p>
  <p>DEFAULT keyword</p>
  <p>This keyword has been introduced with full functionality for defining default 
    values for table columns. Special cases 'CURRENT_DATE','CURRENT_TIME','CURRENT_TIMSTAMP', 
    'TODAY' and 'NOW' can set DATE, TIME and TIMESTAMP columns with current values 
    when an INSERT statement is executed.</p>
  <p>SIZE and PRECISION</p>
  <p>Maximum column sizes for CHAR, VARCHAR, and other types are now stored in 
    the database. The CHAR and VARCHAR sizes can be enforced when INSERT, UPDATE 
    and SELECT ... INTO table operations are performed. The enforcement is optional 
    and turned off by default.</p>
  <p>SAVEPOINT for TRANSACTION</p>
  <p>New feature to allow transactions to rollback to a specified point.</p>
  <p>CONSTRAINTS and INDEXES</p>
  <p>Primary keys declared as CONSTRAINT &lt;name&gt; PRIMARY KEY, either on a 
    single column or on multiple columns, are now accepted and used. All constrains 
    are named, with those generated by the system given unique names as SYS_CT_&lt;n&gt;.</p>
  <p>Each INDEX must have a unique name within the database. This conforms to 
    SQL standards.</p>
  <p>FOREIGN KEYS, ON DELETE CASCADE</p>
  <p>Foreign key constraints referencing the same table are now allowed. New, 
    stricter rules require a unique index to exist on the referenced column (this 
    is the recommended behaviour for new databases but is turned off by default 
    for existing databases). </p>
  <p>ON DELETE CASCADE qualifiers are now supported for foreign keys in data definition 
    scripts. These qualifiers are enforced with fast searches on underlying indexes. 
  </p>
  <p>New support for ALTER TABLE allows 'forward-referencing' foreign keys where 
    the referencing table is created before the referenced table.</p>
  <p>TRIGGERS</p>
  <p>New multiple-row trigger queues are introduced to improve performance. Enhancements 
    to prevent deadlocks are also added.</p>
  <p>TEMP tables</p>
  <p>Full support for session-specific temporary tables is introduced. TEMP tables 
    can be used in any statement the same way as ordinary tables, the differences 
    are they are not visible to other session and are dropped when the session 
    is closed. Also, FOREIGN KEY constraints for ordinary tables cannot reference 
    a TEMP table for obvious reasons (TEMP tables can have foreign keys that reference 
    any ordinary or temp table).</p>
  <p>TEXT tables</p>
  <p>Full support for delimited text files (such as CSV) as the data source for 
    SQL tables.</p>
  <p>VIEWS</p>
  <p>Views are supported as global objects. Internally, each time the view is 
    used, the underlying select statement is performed. Views can be created and 
    dropped using the following statements.</p>
  <p><br>
    CREATE VIEW &lt;viewname&gt; AS SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ....<br>
    DROP VIEW &lt;viewname&gt; {IF EXISTS}</p>
  <p>ALTER</p>
  <p>The following statements are now supported:</p>
  <p>ALTER TABLE &lt;name&gt; RENAME TO &lt;newname&gt;</p>
  <p>All tables can now be renamed. </p>
  <p>ALTER TABLE &lt;name&gt; ADD COLUMN &lt;column definition&gt; [BEFORE &lt;existing 
    name&gt;]<br>
    ALTER TABLE &lt;name&gt; DROP COLUMN &lt;colname&gt;</p>
  <p>A column can be added to the column list, so long as its definition does 
    not include PRIMARY KEY or IDENTITY keywords. If a DEFAULT clause is used 
    in the definition, its value is used in all the existing rows. Any column 
    can be dropped unless it is part of the column list for a constraint or index.</p>
  <p>ALTER TABLE &lt;name&gt; DROP CONSTRAINT &lt;constname&gt;</p>
  <p>Any constraint apart from primary key can be dropped. The index backing the 
    constraint is dropped if not referenced by a foreign key.</p>
  <p>ALTER TABLE &lt;name&gt; ADD CONSTRAINT &lt;constname&gt; UNIQUE &lt;column 
    list&gt;</p>
  <p>Unique constraints can be added. A new index is created if necessary.</p>
  <p>ALTER TABLE &lt;name&gt; ADD CONSTRAINT &lt;constname&gt; FOREIGN KEY &lt;foreign 
    key definition&gt;</p>
  <p>Both backward and forward referencing foreign keys are supported.</p>
  <p>ALTER INDEX &lt;name&gt; RENAME TO &lt;newname&gt;</p>
  <p>Any index can be renamed, so long as it is not a primary key index or an 
    automatically created index on the referencing columns of a foreign key.</p>
  <p>DROP INDEX &lt;name&gt;</p>
  <p>Any index can be dropped, so long as it is not a primary key index or an 
    automatically created index on the referencing columns of a foreign key or 
    an index backing a constraint.</p>
  <p>SQL NAMES</p>
  <p>Full support for quoted SQL object names which can include any Unicode character. 
    This applies to TABLE, COLUMN, CONSTRAINT and INDEX names.</p>
  <p>* Functions</p>
  <p>SET FUNCTION such as COUNT AVG SUM now accept the DISTICT parameter. This 
    feature is<br>
    supported only when GROUP BY is not used in the query.</p>
  <p>A number of bugs in functions such as ABS, CONCAT and SUBSTR have been fixed.</p>
  <p>A small number of new functions have been added.</p>
  <p>The SOUNDEX function has been rewritten according to standards.</p>
  <p>* Expressions</p>
  <p>Arithmetic expressions in SQL statements are now fully supported. Previously, 
    when an arithmetic expression was used to INSERT or UPDATE a value, the first 
    term had to be of the same type as the columns. For example 2*1.2 could not 
    be inserted into a DECIMAL or DOUBLE column. Now all expressions are evaluated 
    and the resulting value can be inserted into a column so long as it can be 
    converted without narrowing.</p>
  <p>More lenient treatment of values for TIMESTAMP columns in INSERT and UPDATE 
    now allows a DATE or part TIMESTAMP string to be used instead of the full 
    pattern.</p>
  <p>BIT columns can be initialised with numeric values in addition to true and 
    false. Numeric value 0 represents false; all other values represent true.</p>
  <p>* Locales</p>
  <p>CHAR, VARCHAR and LONGVARCHAR columns can now be sorted according to the 
    current JVM locale. This feature is optional and turned off by default. If 
    turned on, it can slow down database operations, especially where indexes 
    on CHAR columns and its variant are used.</p>
  <p>* Error Trapping</p>
  <p>Some errors in SQL statements that were not reported before and resulted 
    in potentially incorrect data are now caught.</p>
  <p>Dropping tables that are referenced by foreign key constraints from other 
    tables is now disallowed regardless of the system-wide REFERENTIAL_INTEGRITY 
    setting.</p>
  <p>Duplicate column names in one table are no longer allowed.</p>
  <p>Duplicate index names are no longer allowed.</p>
  <p>Using system table names for user tables is disallowed.</p>
  <p>INSERT INTO table (a,b,c,...) VALUES (x,y,z,...) statements require the count 
    of names and values to match.</p>
  <p>* Enhancements to JDBC</p>
  <p>JDBC ResultSet objects are now scrollable and fully support absolute and 
    relative positioning.</p>
  <p>Extra getXXX() methods are now supported, including getAsciiStream(), getUnicodeStream(), 
    getCharacterStream().</p>
  <p>Optional use of column labels (aliases) as the return value for getColumnName(int 
    i) calls. This is turned off by default.</p>
  <p>JDBC PreparedStatement support has been enhanced with support for setting 
    and reading Date, Time and Timestamp values with a given Calendar object. 
    This allows, among others, specifying different time zones for values that 
    are set or read.</p>
  <p>Extra setXXX() methods are now supported, including setAsciiStream(), setUnicodeStream(), 
    setCharacterStream().</p>
  <p>setObject() methods of PreparedStatement have been improved to allow storage 
    of any serializable object in columns of SQL type, OTHER.</p>
  <p>JDBC DatabaseMetaData getImportedKeys(), getExportedKeys(), getCrossReference(), 
    getBestRowIdentifier() are now supported.</p>
  <p>* Interoperability Enhancements</p>
  <p>HsqlServerFactory allows interoperability with application servers.</p>
  <p>An embedded server (an HSQLDB server started inside another application) 
    can be directed to avoid calling System.exit() when the SHUTDOWN command is 
    issued to the database for admin purposes.</p>
  <p>javax.jdbc.DataSource interface has been introduced as an experimental feature. 
    In order to include this support, the source code should be compiled with 
    JDK 1.4 or with appropriate J2EE jars present in the class path.</p>
  <p>* Performance Enhancements</p>
  <p>Very large CHAR, VARCHAR, LONGVARCHAR values are now supported in all types 
    of tables.</p>
  <p>Major overhaul of internal operations to drastically reduce creation of temporary 
    objects and type conversion.</p>
  <p>Code enhancements to reduce unnecessary method calls in loops.</p>
  <p>Enhancements to avoid duplicate indexes (in source code but not activated).</p>
  <p>* Reliability Enhancements</p>
  <p>Many bugs that existed in 1.43 have been fixed.</p>
  <p>Better catching of error conditions and special cases such as null values.</p>
  <p>Correct treatment of large binary data.</p>
  <p>Better enforcement of internal data consistency in a number of areas.</p>
  <p>* Utilities</p>
  <p>New Script Tool class allows executing an SQL script.</p>
  <p>Enhancements to Transfer Tool to allow the user to save the transfer settings 
    and load them in future sessions. Additional enhancements to support different 
    database source and targets in a modular way.</p>
  <p>Swing versions of Transfer Tool and Database Manager.</p>
  <p>* Build</p>
  <p>Better Ant build with automatic detection of JDK version</p>
  <p>List of patches and fixes numbered by SourceForge Tracker ID's.</p>

  <p>======================================================================================</p>
  <p>HSQLDB v. 1.61</p>
  <p>Changes 20 July 2001</p>
  <p>The following enhancements and bug fixes have been introduced:<br>
    Patch or Bug tracking numbers are included where one exists.</p>
  <p>Compatibility with version 1.43 databases.<br>
    Database files created with 1.43 can be opened with version 1.61. The<br>
    database is converted into the 1.6x format. As a precaution against future<br>
    problems, databases created with later versions cannot be opened by this <br>
    version(1.60 and 1.61, 1.6x are considered the same version but 1.6x and <br>
    1.7x are different versions).</p>
  <p>The LIMIT keyword for fetching only part of the result set.</p>
  <p>SELECT LIMIT n m { selectExpression | table.* | * } [, ... ] .........</p>
  <p>The LIMIT keyword can be used immediately after the SELECT keyword and has<br>
    two numbers as parameters. The query is executed as if LIMIT and its <br>
    parameters were not present, then the rows after the offset position (n)<br>
    and specified by count (m) are returned. Offset n is counted from one.<br>
    &quot;SELECT LIMIT 10 20 * FROM mytable&quot; returns rows 11-30 only<br>
    Currently LIMIT cannot be used together with DISTINCT</p>
  <p><br>
    418019 Timestamp format</p>
  <p>418022 Char comparison</p>
  <p>418023 SUBSTR </p>
  <p>416144 416146 430615 GROUP BY used with aggregate functions:<br>
    a new patch, without side-effects, has been used</p>
  <p>425495 setObject</p>

  <p>Changes 06 July 2001</p>
  <p><br>
    I have checked the bug reports and patches and indicated my opinion as to<br>
    which patches / bug fixes should be done for the 1.61 point release,<br>
    stating NO or OK. I have incorporated some of these and fixed one myself.<br>
    In addition, the patch for database migration from 1.43 to 1.6x that I <br>
    submitted on 16 April should be incorporated into the point release.</p>
  <p>There were 10 patches up to 16 April, which according to Mark, have been 
    <br>
    incorporated. Except:</p>
  <p>OK-------416149 Swing interface for DatabaseManager - ok - but file is missing</p>
  <p>Patches since 16 April:</p>

  <p>OK-------418019 Timestamp format - ok - won't break existing code<br>
    INCORPORATED fredt</p>
  <p><br>
    OK-------418022 Char comparison<br>
    fredt: - patch is ok - do we want this as it can break existing code<br>
    fredt: - now I think we should add it anyway. Side effects would be minimal.<br>

    Bugs</p>
  <p><br>
    OK-------416138 Resolved: The user should use switchtojdk11 before the build</p>
  <p>NO-------416139 Multiple result sets<br>
    fredt: High Hopes?</p>
  <p><br>
    -------416140 PATCH for getMoreResults() - ok</p>
  <p>ALREADY IN VERSION 1.60 fredt</p>
  <p><br>
    OK-------416141 DatabaseMetaData.getExportedKeys() does not work :<br>
    fredt: I know this one from Hypersonic. May be able to fix it.</p>
  <p>fredt: In DatabaseInformation.java, getSystemTable(,,) creates a table on 
    the<br>
    fly for metadata information and then fills it with information from tTable.<br>
    Code has been written to fill the SYSTEM_TABLES, SYSTEM_TYPES, etc.<br>
    but not FOREIGN_KEY etc. as these would be more complicated.<br>
    I hope to get a bit of extra time in the near future to implement<br>
    this and related calls, getExportedKeys(), getCrossReference(), etc.</p>
  <p><br>

  <p>======================================================================================</p>
  <p>Changes to HSQLDB v. 1.60 directory structure and introduction of an<br>
    Ant build.xml</p>
  <p><br>
    The original directory structure of HypersonicSQL had evolved around a set 
    of<br>
    demos and the hsql.jar file was located in the /demo directory.</p>
  <p>There was no /lib directory and the javax.servlet classes were in the same<br>
    folder as the source code. This arrangement was somewhat useful with jdk1.1.x<br>
    as it did not require a classpath argument for some of the compile and run 
    tasks.<br>
    But it has no major advantage with jdk1.3.</p>
  <p>In HSQLDB, all classes are in the org.hsqldb. tree, compared to HypersonicSQL's<br>
    org.hsql. This change already dictates that any existing .html, .bat, .sh 
    and<br>
    other command files that are in use for running the database, or its utility<br>
    classes, have to be edited to reflect the new tree name.</p>
  <p>HypersonicSQL only included .bat files for development and running tasks. 
    The<br>
    development of Apache Ant has made it possible to perform compile and build 
    tasks<br>
    in a platform-independent manner. So a build.xml script for Ant is highly<br>
    desirable.<br>
    <br>
    These circumstances justify the introduction a new directory structure which<br>
    follows the standards used by Sun and others to distribute Java programs. 
  </p>
  <p><br>
    Changes:</p>
  <p>Summary of Changes:</p>
  <p>/bin /lib and /classes directories have been added to the root directory 
    of the<br>
    installation. Some existing files have been moved to these directories. All<br>
    command files have been updated to work within the new structure.</p>
  <p>Details of Changes:</p>
  <p>/bin is almost empty now but will hold .bat and .sh files used for creating<br>
    databases and running different configuration of the server. Unlike the<br>
    versions in /demo, these will not create a test database and will expect the<br>
    user to specify a database. <br>
    (.sh files will be added after some work to make them independent of java<br>
    runtime location)</p>
  <p>/lib contains the javax.servlet precompiled classes (moved from /src) and 
    is<br>
    the location of the hsqldb.jar file when it is created.</p>
  <p>/classes contains the org.hsqldb classes while the .jar is being built and<br>
    CodeSwitcher.java is used to convert source code. It is normally deleted after<br>
    the operation.</p>
  <p>In /src there is an Ant build.xml that builds the hsqldb.jar. (Ant must be 
    <br>
    already installed). To use it, change to /src then type:</p>
  <p>ant</p>
  <p>This displays the command line options which include</p>
  <p>ant jar to make the hsqldb.jar<br>
    ant clean to clean up the /classes directory that is created<br>
    ant cleanall to remove the old jar as well<br>
    ant switchtojdk11 to process and change the code for jdk1.1.x<br>
    ant switchtojdk12 to process and change the code for jdk1.2.x and 1.3.x</p>
  <p>In /demo all the html and bat files have been changed to reflect the<br>
    new relative location of the hsqldb.jar file. The .bat files all work.</p>
  <p>In .html files, the codebase argument was added to the Applet tag. The<br>
    in-memory and client-server .html demos all work</p>
  <p>/src/build.bat works with jdk1.1x and above. It puts the hsqldb.jar file 
    in<br>
    /lib and takes account of the new location of javax classes.</p>
  <p>All the other .bat files work, except:</p>
  <p>switchtoprofile.bat<br>
    switchtoruntime.bat</p>
  <p>There is a problem with the same .bat files in HypersonicSQL 1.43. The new 
    format <br>
    of the 1.60 code and the addition of comments in 1.60 just result in extra<br>
    errors. </p>
  <p>THESE .bat FILES CORRUPT THE SOURCES, so that if they are performed one followed<br>
    by the other, the sources no longer compile correctly (tested with jdk1.3).</p>
  <p>***I suggest not to include them in the distribution until there is a<br>
    resolution.</p>
  <p>I think the new directory structure can be introduced as the remaining minor<br>
    problems are definitely not related to the change of directory structure.</p>
  <p>Tests have been performed on Win NT 4 SP6A with jdk1.3.0_02 and jdk1.1.8. 
    In<br>
    both test environments, a minimal classpath was used. Internet Explorer 5.5 
    was<br>
    used for testing .html Applets</p>

  <p>======================================================================================<br>
    Code Changes in 1.60</p>
  <p>Several minor fixes, code formatted to Sun standards, Javadoc comments started.</p>
  <p>Issues Addressed:</p>
  <p>Problem: LONGVARBINARY error using setObject.<br>
    When using setObject to set the value of a binary column a class cast<br>
    error occured. Added methods to resolve this, bug and fix submitted by ?.</p>
  <p>Problem: BINARY data types were limited to 32K.<br>
    Added support for larger objects. Bug and fix submitted by Jonathan Tappan.<br>
    <br>
    Problem: Cached table corruption<br>
    Modified Cache class to update free space list correctly. Bug and fix <br>
    submitted by Jonathan Tappan.<br>
    <br>
    Problem: readonly property causes stack dump in Log class<br>
    Bug and fix submitted by Donatella Mori and Richard Hoad.<br>
    <br>
    Problem: getMoreResults fails to follow JDBC spec.<br>
    Bug and fix submitted by Brent Boyer.<br>
    <br>
    Problem: Subselect bugs<br>
    Bug and fix submitted by Mark Muday.<br>
    <br>
    Problem: hsql connection type converted to http by jdbcConnection class.<br>
    Bug and fix submitted by Elize Jensen.<br>
    <br>
    Problem: INTERNAL connection type being closed incorrectly, causing, among 
    other <br>
    things, CALL IDENTITY() to fail. Bug and fix provided by Mauro Canal.</p>
  <p>New Features: <br>
    <br>
    Extended SQL syntax for DROP TABLE to allow 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS &lt;table&gt;'. 
  </p>
  <p>Logicscope Realisations Ltd. graciously sponsored Peter Hudson who developed<br>
    the trigger implementation for HSQLDB.</p>
  <p>Postponed Features:</p>
  <p>Reworked transactions mechanism. The problem with the old mechanism <br>
    (as I understand it) was that during a transaction, the uncommitted records 
    were <br>
    available to other channels, i.e. they can read uncommitted changes that may 
    be<br>
    rolled back in the case of an aborted transaction. The modification <br>
    allows 2 phase transactions, where the updates are not visible outside of 
    the <br>
    Channel until the transaction is committed. Patch submitted by Valerio Aimale. 
    <br>
    The concept is sound, but the changes caused problems, perhaps due to other 
    changes<br>
    in this release.</p>

  <p>1.44 is a retrospective package that can be used for comparison with <br>
    later versions of HSQLDB.<br>
    It consists of the code base for Hypersonic 1.43 with<br>
    the following modifications only:</p>
  <p>Code formatted to Sun standards.<br>

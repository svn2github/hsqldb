+ Can't "get" the same datum more than once.
    It seems that jdbc:odbc can't use the same getter twice.  For example, with
        resultSet.getInt(3);
        resultSet.getInt(3);
    the second getter would complain "No data found".
    hsqlodbc (and its predecessor psqlodbc) limit this even more, so that you
    can't even use a different getter for the same cell.  The second getter
    here will fail too:
        resultSet.getInt(3);
        resultSet.getString(3);

Multibyte support was added by Sankyo Unyu Service, (C) 2001.

The code contained in this library is based on code written by
Christian Czezatke and Dan McGuirk (C) 1996, and later maintained by
Julie Ann Case.  (It was probably originally written to support PostgreSQL).

As part of a commercial research project, the developers at Insight
Distributions System overhauled the driver. Their goal was to make the driver
commercially viable. In keeping with the spirit with which the original source
was acquired, Insight published their work for the public. Some time later and
after some discussion with members of the PostgreSQL organization, psqlODBC
was adapted as the part of the PostgreSQL source distribution. The driver
continued to be maintained by Byron Nikolaidis, the developer at Insight who
overhauled the driver for some time.

The PostgreSQL project took over maintenance of the driver at this point, and
continue to maintain it as "psqlODBC".  Peter Eisentraut provided a UNIX/C
build system to make the project independent of the main PostgreSQL baseline.
I, Blaine Simpson, branched the psqlodbc code for HyperSQL in early 2009.
Our branch "is" the HyperSQL ODBC Driver.  In conclusion, the HyperSQL ODBC
Driver, hsqlodbc, is a branch off of psqlODBC (PostgreSQL's ODBC driver), and
the two are significantly different, as they support database servers which are
significantly different.

The HyperSQL ODBC driver has benefitted by several of the excellent Gnu
development tools, and from OpenSSL, unixoDBC, and WiX.  We hereby
recognize the GNU Project, the OpenSSL Project, the unixODBC Project, and
the WiX developers.

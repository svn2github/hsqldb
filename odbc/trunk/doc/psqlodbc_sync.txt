The critical thing to understand is that our psqlodbc-derived code is
synchronized up to the point in time recorded in the file
"config/psqldb_syncpoint.txt".  I hereafter call this point in time the
"psqlodbc sync point".

Use "bin/psqlupdates.bash" to list differences between the (last) psqlodbc
sync point and any specified time (defaulting to now).

The psqlupdates.bash script is obviously for Bash shell only.
This script can easily be ported to CMD shell, but it will still require the
traditional, command-line CVS client, which is freely available for Windows.
If you want the ability to list the psqlodbc baseline differences, and you
have (or plan to get) command-line CVS, contact me
(blaine dot simpson at admc dot com), and I will port psqlupdates.bash to
Windows.


The psqlodbc code base lives in the CVS module "psqlodbc" at

    :pserver:anonymous@cvs.pgfoundry.org:/cvsroot/psqlodbc


ORIGINAL population of our src branch was done from our project root dir with:

    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.pgfoundry.org:/cvsroot/psqlodbc  \
      export -D '2009/02/02 UTC' -d src psqlodbc

Before any change was made to any psqlodbc file, I tagged our baseline with
PSQLODBC_PRISTINE*.

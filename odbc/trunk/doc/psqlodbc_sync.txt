Until I make the scripts to automate the process, use this file to document
synchronization of our source files with the psqlodbc project's code baseline
at
      :pserver:anonymous@cvs.pgfoundry.org:/cvsroot/psqlodbc

ORIGINAL population of src branch was done from our project root dir with:

    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.pgfoundry.org:/cvsroot/psqlodbc  \
      export -D '2008/02/01 GMT' -d src psqlodbc

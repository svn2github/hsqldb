Need to get a unique code/number for our driver's product/service for use with
the Windows MSI installer.  Procedure is documented in the Wix tutorial, I
think.  (Looks like it may be the Package Id in the *.wxs files).

Enhance or replace msi-src/make.bat.  Doesn't even have a clean target, and 
the process needs one.

Update license RTF file, which has obsolete FSF address.

Abort processing at
connection.c:CC_send_query_append(), op switch for op 'Z'.
This state is very likely to result in deadlock.

Abort processing at
socket.c:SOCK_get_id(), the sock-reslen > 0 block ("has to eat...").
This is a serious comm error and should not be ignored.

Rename the *packet_build() function(s) so they are not misleading.  They do not
just build packets, but perform transmissions.

Move output directories out of the "src" branch, for both UNIX and Windows.

Look into wiping code that uses
Non- conninfo[_]->use_server_side_prepare, since we always use server-side
prepares.

Look into of use_declarefetch setting (based on "Use Declare/Fetch" driver
setting.  DECLARE/FETCH/MOVE/CLOSE commands, which don't have, are needed to
support this.

Update DocBook docs with content of my *.txt files.

Track down bytea as LO setting.  Understand then eliminate it.

Add screen shots of both Windows DSN option screens.

Pull remaining pieces of *build*.html files into my *build*.txt files so can
remove the former.

Abort processing at
connection.c:CC_send_query_append(), op switch for op 'Z'.
This state is very likely to result in deadlock.

Abort processing at
socket.c:SOCK_get_id(), the sock-reslen > 0 block ("has to eat...").
This is a serious comm error and should not be ignored.

Rename the *packet_build() function(s) so they are not misleading.  They do not
just build packets, but perform transmissions.

Move output directories out of the "src" branch, for both UNIX and Windows.

Look into wiping code that uses
Non- conninfo[_]->use_server_side_prepare, since we always use server-side
prepares.



IMPLEMENTATION OF BINARY SUPPORT:
    Seems to be entirely unused by jdbc:odbc.  It is very likely that nobody
     would ever use it.

    I have verified that SIMPLE queries of bytea values send 0 (text) cols
     and D rows.
    We so not need to support the binary ability of server-side curses (which
     only works in psqlodbc SIMPLE mode).
    Bind operations supports sending Binary parameters, and specification of
     receiving row data with binary format (1).

Fix bug that we inherited from psqlodbc:

#########  IMPORTANT ########################################################
This file documents building hsqlodbc from the command line, using Microsoft
Visual C++ 2008's "nmake".  The key artifacts that make this work are the files
"win32.mak", "win64.mak", "hsqlodbc.vcproj".
I have not built with the IDE, but I think that process would use the files
"hsqlodbc.sln" and/or "hsqlodbc.dsp".  The IDE settings will have to be
updated to parallel the many improvements and updates to "win*.mak" and
"hsqlodbc.vcproj".
TODO:  Get a Windows C IDE person's help to determine which config files are
used (I suspect that *.dsp is obsolete); and to update them.
Unless you are very handy with the IDE, you are advised to do builds using
nmake for now.

* Notice *  SSL capability is disabled for now.
            We will add this capability back when we have time to implement
            the necessary server-side support in the HyperSQL Engine.

* Notice *  I do not have access to a 64 bit Windows development system, so
            the information about 64-bit builds and my considerable edits to
            win64.mak are untested.

ONE-TIME SETUP FOR DLL BUILDING

    Install the current MS Visual C++ Express edition from
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/express .  As I write this, the current version
    is "2008" with SP1.  Until we make the build scripts more flexible, this
    is the version you need.  You can install to any directory, and you can
    certainly uncheck the option to install SQL Server.

    [ THIS STEP UNNECESSARY UNTIL WE ENABLE SSL AGAIN
    Install the current NON-LIGHT! OpenSSL for platform from
    http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html (misnomer, 64 binaries too).
    Install to default location, select to install shareds to bin, not your
    Windows directory.  (I am not yet working with SSL.  I am seeing
    conflicting information as to whether OpenSSL is required on Windows.
    The code is looking like OpenSSL is needed only for libpq.. which we
    do not want, and SSPI is needed for SSL capability.) ]


ONE-TIME SETUP FOR MSI (Windows Installer) BUILDING

    Install a 3.x of Wix from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix .
    Don't need the extra products.  Just get Wix3.*-x86-setup.zip and execute
    it.  You can change the installation directory to whatever you want, but
    be careful about changing other settings.

    Ignore the warning from the Wix installer about Votive.  You don't
    need any other products or add-ons.


BUILDING driver DLLs

    The installation of Visual C++ adds global variable VS90COMNTOOLS.
    Run %VS90COMNTOOLS%\vsvars32.bat to set up your MSV C++ build environment.
    (Presumably .../vsvars64.bat on a 64-bit system).

    Edit "src/configure.ac" and change the 2nd parameter to AC_INIT to your
    desired version number.  IMPORTANT:  You must use 4-integer dotted
    notation with no extra white space!  Don't expect things to work if you
    do not.

    To make the Unicode DLL (better ODBC support):
        nmake /f win32.mak
    To make the ANSI DLL (required for some older/unmaintained/bad clients):
        nmake /f win32.mak DRIVER_VARIANT=ansi

    Obviously, substitute "win64.mak" for 64-bit systems.

    Run "nmake /f win32.mak HELP" (or same with win64.mak) to see the other
    available targets (like "CLEAN"), and several available build settings.
    MSDTC is for transactions spanning multiple data sources, just like Java's
     XA JDBC features.  MSDTC is required for building merge modules or msi's.

    The output, including the output DLLs, get written to subdirectories of
    "build" (which is a peer directory to "src").

    BEWARE!!!:  If nmake fails, do not expect the real failure details to
     appear near where it aborts.  You must examine all of the nmake output.


BUILDING MSI INSTALLER

    You really need the MSI Installer, because
        Editing ODBC.ini file has no effect.
        Regedit doesn't work.

    Put the Wix program's bin directory into your search path.

    Run the nmake commands above for both the Unicode and ANSI DLLs.
    Then run the build script in the "msi-src" directory, specifying the
    platform.

        cd src
        nmake /f win32.mak
        nmake /f win32.mak DRIVER_VARIANT=ansi
        cd ..\msi-src
        build win32

    If you use TARGETENV=debug for your nmake, then you need to set env.
    var DEBUG (like "setenv DEBUG=true") before running the MSI build.

    Change the 32's to 64's for a 64 bit system build.

    The output *.msi file gets written to the peer "dist" directory.

    Application integrators can use the generated *.msm file which gets built
    by the same procedure.

UNIX Build Procedure

  cd src

  autoreconf -i

  ./configure --disable-openssl   # Until we add SSL capability back

  make

The final output gets written to ".libs/hsqlodbcu.so" ("src/.libs/hsqlodbcu.so"
from the project home directory).  This location will be changing.

Run "make maintainer-clean" to reset/clear all the steps above.

Add parameter "--disable-unicode" to "configure" to build the ANSI driver
"hsqlodbca.so" insteadf of "hsqlodbcu.so".

**** IMPORTANT RUNTIME TIPS ****

The unixODBC graphical program "ODBCConfig" just does not work for any driver
I have ever tried to add.  If the same applies to you, you will need to edit
the files

    /etc/odbc.ini      Driver definitions
    /etc/odbcinst.ini  Global DSN definitions
    $HOME/.odbc.ini    Personal DSN definitions
    
See the RUNTIME SETTINGS section in the notes.txt file.

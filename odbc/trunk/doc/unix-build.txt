UNIX Build Procedure

  cd src

  autoreconf -i

  ./configure --disable-openssl   # Until we add SSL capability back

  make

The final output gets written to ".libs/psqlodbcw.so" ("src/.libs/psqlodbc.so"
from the project home directory).  This location will be changing.

Run "make maintainer-clean" to reset/clear all the steps above.


**** IMPORTANT RUNTIME TIPS ****

The unixODBC graphical program "ODBCConfig" just does not work for any driver
I have ever tried to add.  If the same applies to you, you will need to edit
the files

    /etc/odbc.ini      Driver definitions
    /etc/odbcinst.ini  Global DSN definitions
    $HOME/.odbc.ini    Personal DSN definitions
    
Until we do further work, you must enable the undocumented DSN setting
"UseServerSidePrepare".  You must set the value to "1" (without the quotes).
Yes, it is boolean, and yes, it is arbitrary, but the value "Yes" will not
work here.

ODBC does not allow an empty string for a DSM database name.  Therefore,
you must specify DSN database name of "/" (without the quotes) to indicate
the default database

You may want to turn on one or more of the log files, with DSN settings like
(counter-intuitively) "Debug" for the mylog and "CommLog" for the comm. log.
Just as for the Server Side Prepare setting above, you must set the value to
"1".

Leave DSN setting "Protocol" unset, or set it to "7.4".

UNIX Build Procedure

* Notice *  SSL capability is disabled for now.
            We will add this capability back when we have time to implement
            the necessary server-side support in the HyperSQL Engine.

PREREQUISITES

    GCC (Gnu C compiler)
    Autoconf >= v2.59
    Automake >= v1.9.2
    Libtool >= v1.5.10
    unixODBC, developer distro (can do a custom build with iodbc instead)


STANDARD BUILD

  Edit "src/configure.ac" and change the 2nd parameter to AC_INIT to your
  desired version number.  IMPORTANT:  You must use 4-integer dotted notation!
  Don't expect things to work if you do not.

  cd src

  autoreconf -i

  ./configure --disable-openssl   # Until we add SSL capability back

  make

The final output gets written to ".libs/hsqlodbcu.so" ("src/.libs/hsqlodbcu.so"
from the project home directory).  This location will be changing.

Run "make maintainer-clean" to reset/clear all the steps above.


INSTALLATION

  Normal users of the HyperSQL ODBC driver will not use "make" to install.
  If you plan to distribute your customized driver build, you will probably
  want to pack up a binary-only distribution that minimizes system
  requirements for the end-user client computer.
  You can use "make" to help you build such a package, or to install the
  driver onto developer workstations.
  Just run "make install" as root from the "src" directory, after you have
  successfully run plain "make" as described under STANDARD BUILD or
  CUSTOMIZED BUILDS.


CUSTOMIZED BUILDS

    Before running "./configure", run "./configure --help" to list the
    available build options.

    Use parameter "--disable-unicode" to build the ANSI driver "hsqlodbca.so"
    instead of "hsqlodbcu.so".

    The "dist" target builds a UNIX-specific source distribution in tar.gz
    format.  (I haven't worked with this yet.  TODO:  Update this after work
    on source distros).

**** IMPORTANT RUNTIME TIPS ****

The unixODBC graphical program "ODBCConfig" just does not work for any driver
I have ever tried to add.  If the same applies to you, you will need to edit
the files

    /etc/odbc.ini      Driver definitions
    /etc/odbcinst.ini  Global DSN definitions
    $HOME/.odbc.ini    Personal DSN definitions
    
See the RUNTIME SETTINGS section in the notes.txt file.
